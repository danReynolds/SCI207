# Life on Exoplanets? Summary.

If life is common in the universe (even just microbial life) we may know soon.

## Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence

* Listening for radio signals from a technologically advanced alien civilization.
* Other astrobiology research makes slow and steady progress. SETI seeks absolute proof in one fell swoop that we are not alone
* Difficult to estimate chance of success. Nevertheless, we have no hope of success unless we try.

Are we an isolated, lone civilization in an incomprehensibly vast cosmos?

Or is there another consciousness out there, amongst the stars?

Humans are intelligent, curious, and aware of the cosmos: looking up and listening.

Voyager 1 & 2: Galactic *message in a bottle* expresses human spirit of hope.

Voyagers 1 & 2 were launched in 1977 to explore the outer solar system. Now streaking through space (133 AU out), headed for the stars (reach in 10s of 1000s of years)

Bolted to the side of each is a gold record containing *sights and sounds of Earth*, and also a map about how to find us.

Info to play audio and video. Also defines **location of Sun**, relative to 14 nearby pulsars.

Frequencies coded in binary, relative to hyperfine 21cm radio emission of hydrogen. Hopefully any civilization that knows physics would get it, since hydrogen is the most common element in the universe.

Using this timecode, they describe how fast you need to rotate the disk. They show you how to display an image recorded as a wave on it.

* SETI originally proposed by physicists **Giuseppe Cocconi** and **Philip Morrisson** in 1959.
* First organized search by astronomer **Frank Drake** in 1960 (Project Ozma)

Current SETI radio search: Alien Telescope Array in California

Operating near 21cm, can detect alien civilizations within about a thousand light-years, about a million stars.

No success to date, but there is hope.

### 1977 Wow! Signal

Noticed by Jerry Ehman, a volunteer astronomer at *Big Ear Radio Observatory*.

Peak intensity over 30 times the galactic background, at the natural, 21cm hydrogen line (the wavelength SETI believes would be natural for aliens to communicate with)

Problem: Never repeated, no explanation, not science, just a curious anomaly.

2012: Arecibo Observatory beamed a response, containing 10,000 twitter messages.

## What Happens if SETI Succeeds?

**Drake Equation**: How can we estimate the number of intelligent civilizations out there that are capable and willing to communicate with us?

N: The number of civilizations in our galaxy in which communication might be possible
R: The average rate of star formation per year in our galaxy
f: The function of stars with planets
n: The average number of planets that can potentially support life per star with planets
fl (life): The fraction that can go on to support life
fi (intelligence): The fraction that can go on to support intelligent life
fc (communication): The fraction of civilizations that develop a technology detectable from space
L: Length of time such civilizations release detectable signals in space

N = R * f * n * f1 * fi * fc * L
  = (R * f * n) x (fl * fi * fc) * L
  = Astronomy x Biology x Sociology

**Astronomy**: Until we discovered exoplanets (especially the Kepler mission), f and n were just guesses. We now have good estimates:

R = average rate of star formation in our galaxy ~ 10 per year
f x n = the average number of planets (per star) that can potentially support life ~ 10 billion earth-sized planets in habitable zone of Sun-like stars out of 10 billion stars in whole galaxy = 1/10

**Biology**: This is hard, we have no good estimates: Maybe:

* fl: fraction of habitable planets that actually develop simple life at some point, 1? Simple life seems maybe inevitable and on Earth began immediately
* fi: Fraction of planets with life that actually develop intelligent life, civilizations. << 1 or ~ 1? Is complexity inevitable? Bottle neck?
* fc: Fraction of civilizations that develop sufficient communication technology? << 1 or ~1? Is technology inevitable? Would they use it? Could they avoid it?

**Sociology**: This is **even harder** to estimate. It is the real wild card.

* L = length of time for which civilizations release detectable signals into space.
* L may be small: 50 years after we invented radio, we invented the atomic bomb. Are advanced civilizations doomed to self-destruct? What about by natural causes, asteroid impacts, etc.
* L may be large: Maybe civilizations can learn to survive their technological infancy and thrive, in spite of tech or with its help, get to star trek.

The main point is that N, the number of civilizations out there, is dependent on L, the sociology aspect. If L is large, the likelihood is pretty high overall that there are civilizations, since L is the only near zero value.

Estimates for N range from << 1 to millions. Therefore the Drake equation is **not** useful to estimate N. It is useful to focus our attention on interesting and important questions.

Questions:

* Even if complex life is widespread, would **intelligence** be common? Think about **convergent evolution**, fish body shape, eyes, brains, it all went one way.
* How do we define intelligence anyways? Would it necessarily spawn science and technology capable of, or even interested in, interstellar communication?
* What kind of communication should we be looking for? Radio? Light? Other? What form? Could we recognize/decode intelligent messages?

We've hardly transmitted anything. Why would we expect others to? Why might we not want to transmit anything? if we do, what should we transmit?

## Fermi Paradox

Assuming that neither we nor our planet is in any way special, the Copernican Principle, suggests that aliens should have colonized the galaxy by now. So why haven't they?

* Not special therefore civilizations are common.
* Stars in our galaxy would have had Earth-like planets starting about 5 billion years ago before Earth was born. Giving those aliens a 5 billion head start to us!
* Interstellar space travel seems exceedingly difficult for us, but in just one century we have imagined many possible ways.

* Nuclear fission/fusion rocket
* Matter-antimatter photon rocket
* Nuclear fission ram-jet
* Einstein friendly warp drive
* Hyperspace/womrholes
* Interstellar biological ark

Assuming that neither we nor our planet is in any way special (Copernican principle), suggests that aliens should have colonized the galaxy by now. Why?

Surely with a 5 billion year head start, said civilizations could master interstellar travel.

Especially if they sent self-replicating (Von Neumann) machines instead of themselves.

Possible Solutions:

* Galactic civilizations are extremely rare. Ours is the first. We are alone.
* Galactic civilizations are common but none have widely colonized the galaxy.
* There is a galactic civilization, but it has deliberately avoided revealing itself to us

Similar considerations apply to the eerie silence so far detected by SETI.

One of these two statements are true:

1. There are billions of habitable Earth-like worlds out there and we are one ofthem
2. We are the only

## Conclusion of Life

Origin of Life, Nature of Life, Extraterrestrial Life are all very active areas of science.

Like poetry, science finds deep connections and unity between superficially disparable things:

* Biology and Chemistry: Evolution and genetics have shown that all life on Earth is part of the **same family**: humans are cousins to chimps, trees, fungus, etc. Biology and chemistry are even beginning to hint at how rocks themselves may have come alive.

* Physics: All physical processes, inanimate (rain and sunshine) or animate (life) obey the **same laws of physics**. At the level of basic physics, there is no distinction between a human and a steam engine. Both operate by the laws of thermodynamics, life may even be a necessary consequence of those laws!

We will now extend these connections and unity even deeper, to the entire universe itself.
