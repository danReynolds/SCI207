# Black Holes

Why strong gravity?

So a black hole is not a giant vacuum cleaner, sucking things in.

How strong can gravity get?

From Earth's surface, the escape velocity is 11km/s

If the mass of the Earth were compressed into a smaller radius, gravity on the surface would get stronger and the escape velocity would increase.

If you make the radius very, very small with the same mass, thent he escape velocity approaches the speed of light.

Gravity at the surface would be strong enough that nothing, not even light, could escape.

The basic idea of a dark star was first proposed by John Michell in 1783.

A dark star, Newtonian gravity, and a black hole, Einstein gravity, are not the same.

Horizon in flat spacetime, special relativity.

Curved spacetime:

accelerate up without moving up. Rocket hovering a fixed distance from a black hole under constant acceleration, like a jetpack. You feel like you're going up, but you're just hovering because of gravity.

Light ray shot radially outward from above the horizon, eventually catches up and goes to infinity.

Light ray shot radially outwards from below the horizon never gets out of the black hole.

Light ray shot radially outwards from the horizon stays on the horizon.

Just light anything can fall into a black hole, anything can come out of a white hole.

Light rays passing near the event horizon are severely deflected.

**Photo sphere:** Light orbits the black hole at R=1.5 Rs. You could see the back of your head!

At rest inside the photon sphere, even some light rays shot above the horizontal bend into the black hole. As your approach the horizon, all but the most vertical rays bend back into the horizon.

Alternatively, as you approach the horizon, its blackness engulfs you and the whole sky shrinks into a smaller and smaller disk above your head.

Light rays can orbit several times before hitting you, so you see multiple copies of the sky.

## Falling into a Black Hole

**Tidal Forces**: Stretching in length and squeezing in width. These get stronger the closer you are to the black hole.

Tidal forces at the horizon between head and toes:

* About 1 million g for a 30 solar mass black hole, you're dead long before you fall through the horizon. Time to hit singularity, 0.0001s

## Time Travel

Time travel to the future is easy, using time dilation.

Time travel to the past is tricky.

First: The mathematics of general relativity certainly allows spacetimes in which it is possible to travel backwards in time. GR itself has no problem with time travel to the past.

But there are two key problems:

* The paradoxes that result (Grandfather Paradox)
* Whether a suitable time machine could, even in principle, be constructed

We shall see that the quantum nature of our universe plays an important role in potentially solving both key problems. This will be a natural segue into discussing quantum mechanics and ultimately quantum gravity, the theory of everything.

## Paradoxes

Classical self-consistency resolution:

Problem: Although this resolves the paradox, it does so at the expense of violating the autonomy principle. The ball that returns tot he past has no choice in what it can do, like when in a sci-fi movie the traveler cannot change the past.

Quantum to the rescue?

For all we know, subatomic particles may be regularly traveling both forwards and backwards in time, all the time. If so, it is obviously not a problem for nature. How could it not be a problem?

Enter: Quantum many-worlds interpretation!

All possible alternate histories are real, each representing an actual world or universe.

Reality is not a single unfolding history, but a many branched tree. So you get autonomy because you go back in time, but just go down the branch that you act, since all things happen, so you aren't forced like in the sci-fi case to do a certain thing.

## David Deutsch's Idea

What if the time traveler simply ends up in a different branch of history than the one she departed from? She disappears from one branch, travels back in time and kills the other one, no logical inconsistencies.

Paradoxes go away in quantum mechanics, so does this show us that maybe we can unify classical and quantum?

## Exotic Matter

What would exotic matter be good for?

A classical wormhole is unstable. The diverging effect of negative mass-energy could be used to stabilize a worm hole.

## Alcubierre Warp Drive

Requires exotic matter. Spaceship is surrounded by a bubble of positive and negative energy matter.

Bubble of matter affects contraction and expansion of space. Space in front contracts, space behind expands. bubble moves faster than light. No problem for GR, think about how rapidly space expanded during inflation!
