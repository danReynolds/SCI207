# Two Profound Properties of the CMB

While the CMB provides strong evidence for a hot, dense beginning, afterglow of the BB, it raises two deep mysteries, which provide profound clues to our ultimate beginning:

1. Why is the temperature of the CMB almost perfectly uniform?

By exactly the same rough argument we gave before, the angular size of the blobs, regions that have the same temperature, should be about 1 degree of the sky.

Show are two blobs of gas, A and B, seen in opposite directions on he sky, light coming from long ago, far away. In the 380,000 years since the BB, the gas in each blob (separately) would have had time to thermalize (come to the same temp), say TA and TB.

In principle, however, TA and TB could be very different temperatures. But in fact, they differ by only 1 part in 100,000. We need to explain this! This is called the **horizon problem**.
They are hugely separated, there is no way the two blobs could communicate, how did they get such similar temperatures?

Current widely adopted hypothesis: **Cosmic Inflation (Alan Guth, 1980)**.

In the early universe (t < 10^-36 seconds), the space in the current observable universe was very tiny, much smaller than the nucleus of an atom.

Although 10^-36 seconds is a very small time, this region was so tiny that any stuff in it, that would eventually give rise to all the matter and radiation in the observable universe today, had plenty of time to thermalize. It was in perfect thermal equilibrium.

Then came a very short period of extremely rapid accelerated expansion, called inflation.

In roughly 10^-32 seconds, space expanded in size by an enormous factor, 10^43, to pick a number, to something, say, the size of a marble.

How? Just simple Einstein/Friedmann equations. All of that matter in the marble sized space expands to cosmic size, and every piece of matter is still at the same temperature, allowing for the near uniform temperature of the blobs of the CMB.

When the marble had expanded to the size of observable universe at 380,000 years, 1100 times smaller than it is today, all of the hot gas in it would have been in **perfect thermal equilibrium**, TA=TB, the CMB would have been **perfectly thermally uniform**.

But this introduces a new problem, since it is not **perfectly** uniform and we have to ask why.

Note:

Inflation also solves the **flatness problem**. CMB observations tell us that space is almost perfectly flat.

Problem: A universe that starts off to close, but not exactly on, the critical curve (corresponding to a flat universe) soon deviates greatly from it, so if the universe is close to critical now, it must have been extremely close to critical in the past. This is a severe fine-tuning problem.

A flat universe is very unstable, like balancing vertically.

Before inflation started, space could have had any random curvature. But inflation allows the entire observable universe to come from an extremely tiny patch of that space, which is extremely flat.

Flat enough that even after cosmic time, space is still almost perfectly flat. Problem solved!

2. Why is it not perfectly uniform?

We discussed how inflation would have made the CMB perfectly uniform. Virtually zero fluctuations in temperature.

How did these temperature fluctuations arise and why do we care?

It is precisely these **tiny** temperature and density fluctuations in the hot gas in the universe at time 380,000 years that we were the **seeds** of gravitational clumping that gave rise to all of the structure in the present universe: stars, galaxies, clusters of galaxies and us.

Without these fluctuations all of the matter (ordinary and dark), would have just expanded uniformly as space expands. No structure would have formed -> no life.

Basic idea:

Before inflation, the bit of space that would eventually expand into our observable universe was very tiny, say 10^-43 metres across.

On this tiny scale, the vacuum would have been filled with **quantum fluctuations**

Normally, quantum fluctuations are submicroscopic. But inflation theory predicts that the extremely rapid expansion of space from 10^-43m across to about the size of a marble would have similarly expanded these submicroscopic quantum fluctuations to macroscopic size, much like expanding space stretches the wavelength of a photon, it stretches the wavelengths of these fluctuations.

By the end of inflation, the expanded quantum fluctuations would have left an imprint on the density and temperature fluctuations.

These then became the seeds of gravitational clumping, giving rise to all of the structure in the present universe, stars, galaxies, clusters of galaxies and us and these seeds were just the right **amplitude**. If the fluctuations were even just half the amplitude, they would have been too weak to form galaxies and clusters of galaxies.

And these seeds were just the right type. Same amplitude across different sizes. Ex. Bigger amplitude at smaller sizes = lots of black holes, at larger sizes = huge aggregates of matter pulling everything in.

Notwithstanding many deep questions that remain, in broad brush strokes, inflation + quantum can actually explain this.

Right or not, we are actually coming up with plausible origin stories like RNA world, but now all the way back at 10^-32 seconds after the Big Bang.

Old Story: We are stardust, story from the 1940s
New Story: We are quantum fluctuations

All of these structures in the universe today originated in quantum fluctuations that existed a tiny fraction of a second after the Big Bang in a region of space much smaller than an atomic nucleus.

During inflation, these microscopic quantum fluctuations were almost instantly expanded to macroscopic size, which we can now see imprinted on the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)

If these 1:100,000 density fluctuations weren't there, the matter (dark and ordinary), would have diluted before gravitational clumping = no galaxies, stars, etc.

## Let's go even deeper

One of the deepest questions of all is: Why is there something rather than nothing?

Of course, no one knows, but here are two intriguing ideas to contemplate:

1. **Quantum**: Spontaneous creation and annihilation
2. **Gravity**: Space itself is dynamical, and gravitational energy is negative

Let's try to put these together:

Normally, virtual particles spontaneously appear and disappear too fast to become real particles.

But near a black hole, Einstein gravity, one can fall in the black hole so that the other cannot find it to annihilate with it, and so becomes a real particle.

Similarly during inflation, also Einstein gravity, the pair is quickly separated and cannot find each other to annihilate with, so both become real particles.

It appears as though we are *getting something from nothing*, but not really:

In the black hole case, the black hole loses the same amount of energy as the created real particle has. In the inflation case, we need some kind of energy to drive the inflation, where does that come from?

It comes from these particles.

Inflation requires a very large cosmological constant, or equivalently a very high vacuum energy density. But the volume of the space when inflation begins, that will eventually become the observable universe, is exceedingly tiny << atomic nucleus

Large energy per unit volume x Exceedingly tiny volume can be a relatively small amount of total energy. All of this expansion can be fueled by a tiny amount of matter.

During inflation, the negative pressure of this vacuum energy drives the accelerated expansion of space, just through the magical math of Einstein's theory.

Every cubic meter of space created, creates more vacuum energy (these virtual particles that form real particles used to fuel the expansion, so it is fueled by itself!). When inflation stops, all this vacuum energy decays into particles, matter and antimatter, and fills the universe with Standard Model particles, photons, electrons, quarks, etc!

So, are we getting something from nothing? Maybe, maybe not.

The total energy, matter plus gravitational, remains constant, conserved, and very small, and could even be zero. Thus, we may not be geteting something from nothing, but nothing from nothing.

Negative gravitational energy counters the actual energy, so it is all nothing.

Like Yin and Yang:

Complementary opposites, positive and negative energy, give rise to each other as they interrelate to one another.

Either way, nothing from nothing, or something from nothing, it's a remarkable story!

Before inflation began, space may had stuff in it: Standard Model particles, exotic particles, etc. Then something happened that triggered inflation, perhaps the energy released when the strong and electroweak forces froze out of the GUT force, like energy released when water freezes?

But the expansion of space during inflation was so extreme that any pre-existing stuff would have been diluted to virtually zero density. Space would have been almost perfectly empty of everything except the uniform inflation vacuum energy. The amount of this energy, in the tiny region of space that would become our observable universe, was small before inflation began, but grew large as space became large.

As mentioned earlier, at the end of inflation, during what's called reheating, this inflation vacuum energy the decayed into the Standard Model particles

If inflation is right, we exist as as direct result of the weird effect that persistent quantum vacuum energy, pressure = negative energy density, has on expanding space.

Did inflation really happen?

It explains the surprising homogeneity of the observable universe: the matter, at any given time in cosmic history, is on average, almost perfectly uniformly distributed, density and temperature. Relatedly it accounts for the observed flatness and absence of magnetic monopoles.

It also explains the origin of the large-scale structure of the universe: microscopic quantum fluctuations, magnified to cosmic scale, became the seeds for the gravitational collapse into the structures we see today. It predicts the peak CMB fluctuations of one degree on the sky, due to flatness, and is consistent with its amplitude (1:100,000)

Technically, detailed prediction: CMB is a *nearly scale invariant Gaussian random field*. The nearly part predicts a spectral index between 0.92 and 0.98. CMB measurements show 0.963 +- 0.012. This is considered an important confirmation.

While there is some evidence supporting inflation, and none against it, and it is a widely pursued hypothesis, with many variants (eternal inflation), it is also widely criticized:

The **inflation field** that drove inflation does not correspond to any known physical field: No concrete connection with particle physics, yet at least.

The theory has ad hoc elements, that can be adjusted to fit a wide range of data.

The initial conditions for inflation itself may be just as fine-tuned as the initial condition, very flat universe, inflation tries to explain.

While inflation (1980+) has provided one plausible origins model, like RNA world inorigin of life, it is still fraught with mysteries and is almost certainly not the final word!

There are other origin hypotheses being pursued:

* Within classical gravity, Roger Penrose's Conformal Cyclic Cosmology
* Within quantum gravity, Loop Quantum Gravity can soften the classical Big Bang singularity and push back to a universe that existed before the Big Bang. Universe started out large and had big collapse, then bounced, rapidly expanding
* Within Superstring Theory, inspired by extra dimensions, D-branes, etc, the cyclic model.

Early universe cosmology is a very active area of physics. There is great interest in understanding where we come from and where we're going.

## External Inflation and the Multiverse

Imagine that space is infinite and eternal. Assuming inflation can occur at all, it may occur at different rates in different places, and hut off after different amount sof time.

All of space could be eternally inflating, and randomly shutting off in pockets, bubble universes.

These universes may have very different randomly determined properties, physical constants, number of dimensions, some may support life, but most probably not.
