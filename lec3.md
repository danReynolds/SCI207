# Eating

Living organisms must eat to sustain themselves.

Something to do with we get "building blocks", amino acids.

But also something to do with calories.

In exploring the origin of life, ti helps to better understand what life is. We will see that energy in particular, the flow of energy and its dispersion is central to this understanding.

But first we must think about the principle of conservation of energy, which is central so all of science.

Beginning with Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, in the 1670s, people realized that in certain mechanical systems, energy is conserved as:

$$\sum{\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}}$$

When a ball collides elastically with a wall, it momentarily comes to rest, and so has no kinetic energy.

However, its shape is distorted, like a compressed spring, it spring backs to its original shape and restores its original energy.

We sometimes say that the distorted ball stores elastic potential energy, but its really energy stored in an atomic scale electric field inside the ball.

## Potential Energy

Atoms are made of electrically charged particles, a positively charged nucleus and negatively charged electrons.

Each charged particle is surrounded by an electric field E.

The electric fields of two or more charged particles add to produce a net electric field in the space around the particles.

An electric field stores energy in the space between charged particles, with energy density $\frac{1}{2}E^{2}$ joules per meter.

Distorting the shape of an elastic ball distorts the atomic scale electric field, changing the energy stored in the field.

As the ball comes to rest, the distortion increases the energy stored in the electric field, at the expense of decreasing the energy stored in the motion of its mass.

As the ball springs back, the reverse happens.

Energy can be also stored in a magnetic field, B, with energy density $\frac{1}{2}B^{2}$

A solar flare converts magnetic field energy into kinetic energy, up to $10^{26}$ or billions of the most powerful nuclear bombs humans have built.

Light is an electromagnetic field:

**Faraday**: A changing magnetic field creates an electric field.

**Maxwell**: A Changing electric field creates a magnetic field.

These two mechanisms work together to create light, a mutually self-sustaining, changing pattern of electric and magnetic fields in space, moving at speed c (speed of light)

Light is potential energy stored in electric and magnetic fields being transported through a medium.

Energy can also be stored in a gravitational field.

When we toss a ball up, it begins with kinetic energy. But at the top of its trajectory the ball is momentarily at rest and has no kinetic energy.

The kinetic energy has been converted into gravitational potential energy, which is really energy stored in the gravitational field of the two masses, Earth and the ball.

This gravitational field energy is converted back into kinetic energy as the ball falls down.

But the total energy, kinetic + potential is conserved.

Gravitational field energy provided the spark that ignited the Sun's thermonuclear fusion reactions.

When a ball bounces elastically, the energy converts back and forth between kinetic and potential (gravitational and electric field) energy, with the total energy being conserved.

But when the bounce is inelastic, it seems as if energy is disappearing. It doesn't bounce high, like on a carpet, so where did the energy go?

Let's focus on the what the collisions with the ground are doing to kinetic energy:

Initially all the particles in the ball are moving in the same direction.

We say that their kinetic energy (KE) is coherent and ordered.

More correctly: **thermal energy** is the total energy associated with the thermal motion of a system of particles, including both kinetic and potential field energies.

All objects store energy in the form of this thermal energy. The hotter a given object, the more thermal energy it has. Temperature is by definition how much energy, how much movement particles have.

## Summary

Energy is conserved. It can flow from place to place, or change its form, but it can never be created or destroyed.

The two basic forms are:

1. Kinetic energy (energy stored in the motion of mass)
2. Potential energy (energy stored in fields: electric, magnetic, and gravitational)

But what is energy?

$E = mc^{2}$, means energy is equivalent to mass.

**Mass**: the resistance of an object to changes in its motion. Another name for mass is inertia.

## What does E = mc^2 mean?

All forms of energy have mass, or inertia, resistance to acceleration.

Potential energy has mass:

Compressing a spring, adding potential energy to the atomic scale electric field inside makes it harder to accelerate the spring.

It also weighs more.

the increase in mass/inertia is:

$m = \frac{E}{c^{2}}$

Electromagnetic energy also has mass:

A mirror box full of light is harder to accelerate than the same box empty.

Turning it around: **mass itself has energy**.

An electron and a positron, the electron's antimatter cousin both have the same rest mass. They can annihilate each other, leaving an equivalent amount of mass-energy in the form of light, photons.

The total **mass** did not change, the total energy does not change, mass is not converted into energy, or vice-versa, its just 20th century alchemy: one type of matter, electrons, is converted into another, photons.

Conservation of energy and conservation of mass are the same law, because energy and mass are equivalent.

electron + positron turns into 2 photons, they change from one type to another.

You don't have mass converted to energy, that is nonsense.

The equivalence of energy and mass is a profound insight into the nature of reality.

It finally answered the deep mystery of what could possibly be powering the Sun. Fusion.
What
Equivalent to a billion billion power plants on Earth.

Where does this energy come from?

In each second, $m = \frac{E}{c^{2}}$.

Every second, a certain amount of energy and mass, the same thing, flow out of the sun.

We are literally eating the Sun, life is profoundly phyiscal.

## What is Energy?

Einstein's second, deeper insight:

mass-energy = warping of spacetime.

Mass-energy is the essence of all things, including life, it is how much space am I warping around me.

If energy is strictly conserved, then energy is eternal.

Energy will never run out, the universe contains the same amount of energy today as it did in the Big Bang.

We can't use energy, or waste energy. Energy will never run out.

What **is** running out is useful energy, called **free energy**. As time goes on, energy is degrading to a lower form, a kind of energy that is not useful.

ex. If part of the universe is really hot, and another really cold, the hot one mixes with the cold one and we get a flow of energy we can couple to.

If the whole universe was hot, then it would not flow. If the universe were to reach equilibrium, no downhills, gradients, then energy would stay where it was, and not transform.

We've got a hot sun right now in a cold sky. If it were a hot sun everywhere, then energy could no longer flow/transform, since there are no temperature differences, and energy will stay where it is unless acted on by an external force. If it is uniform, then it has no external force to flow or move or transform.

When free energy runs out, the universe can no longer sustain processes that use up free energy, like computation or life.

This possibility is called the **heat death of the universe** and was originated by Kelvin in 1852.

All of this is intimately connected with the concepts of entrop and the second law of thermodynamics.

## Entropy

Every physical process obeys the law of **conservation of energy**.

But it's easy to imagine processes that obey this law that don't actually happen.

Ex. An egg that breaks could reverse, and sound waves from the crack could travel backwards, converging on the egg and it could reform and fly up off the plate. This wouldn't violate conservation of energy, since none is lost or added, so why does it not?

What is the origin of this apparent time asymmetry in the way that nature works?

ex. When a hot cup of coffee cools down to room temperature, thermal energy flows from the coffee molecules to the air molecules, in a way that conserves total energy.

The reverse process also conserves total energy, but never happens. The energy could flow back into the coffee, but it never does. Why does it go from hot to cold but not cold to hot.

There must be another law at work, beyond conservation of energy, this other law seems to involve the **direction of flow** of energy or how energy tends to **distribute** itself.

## Brownian Motion

A random walk of a larger particle resulting from its collisions with smaller, surrounding atoms or molecules that are in random thermal motion.

Like a basketball getting knocked around by a thousand tennis balls. Under a microscope we might see the big basketball, but not see the smaller tennis balls that knock it around.

History:

**Lucretius**: 60BC on the **Nature of Things**, used the random motion of dusty air in a shaft of sunlight as evidence for Democritus' idea of atoms.

Named after the Botanist Robert Brown, who in 1827, observed similar random motion of pollen grains in water.

Mathematical descriptions began in the late 1800s, Einstein 1905 made detailed quantitative analysis of Brownian motion that provided definitive confirmation that atoms and molecules actually existed.

## Diffusion

Diffusion is the net migration of particles from a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration.

Diffusion is similar to Brownian motion: Each particle moves independently of the others, in a purely random thermal motion. So why is there a net migration from higher to lower concentrations?

Diagram:

Particles in any one layer are equally likely to move left as right. There is a net motion to the right simply because there are more particles in the left.

If the same proportion, say 40%, randomly move left to right as right to left, then more move left to right since there were just more to the left.

Diffusion continues until there is equal density everywhere, a dynamic equilibrium of particles moving left->right as right->left.

Nature has no inherent preference for one state over another. There are simply many more ways for the articles to be spread out than localized.

Even a tiny amount of spreading opens up a vast increase in the number of nearby states like this, compared to the less spread out state it came from.

Statistically, there are more ways that particles can be laid out that are widely spreads out then clumped together, so random motion statistically favors that they become spread out.

By the law of large numbers, should spread out.
