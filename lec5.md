# Order from Disorder

A human is at least just as complex as a machine:

It takes in low entropy material containing high quality energy: food fuel

It burns this food fuel and expels waste high entropy material, low quality energy, excrement and body heat.

In the process, it constructs low entropy materials, DNA, cells, etc and extracts highly ordered energy for locomotion, consciousness and others.

Piston goes up and down as a result of a natural flow from hot to cold. Extracts order from the disorder.

Our bodies are full of things like this.

## How is a Living Organism Essentially Identical to a Piston Engine?

## How could a machine as complex as a human spontaneously arise in the first place?

Could those structures emerge spontaneously?

## Natural spontaneously creates ordered structures like snow flakes, if I'm just a snowflake what does this say about the purpose of life?

Thinking about life in the context of basic physics provides a thought-provoking perspective. In general, that's what science does, it challenges our thinking.

Considering that physics is the most fundamental of the sciences, is this perspective saying something fundamental about the nature of life?

Or is physics one of many equally important perspectives from all other disciplines, biology, chemistry, fine arts, literature, theology, etc. Surely all peerspectives enrich our understanding of the multifaceted wonder of life.

Can nature **spontaneously** create order and complexity?

A piston took complex human thought to make to create order from complexity. But nature does the same process all the time.

Near the beginning of the universe, all of space was filled with matter. At the time the matter was super hot and super dense. There was basically no order or structure. As time goes on, space expands, and the amount of room for that matter expands, so the matter fills that area, because of statistical probability of entropy, the matter expands to fills the container and cools. Creating galaxies and clusters of galaxies.

The dust combines to make planets, which are highly ordered structures, with layered cores and high complexity.

## The Universe Cools

The universe began in a hot dense state (Big Bang) with almost no structure. Ever since then it has been expanding and cooling, causing various structures to condense out.

At one time, all of space was filled basically with hot protons, neutrons, electrons and photons (particles of light). As these gasses cooled, the electrons combined with protons, resulting in **neutal hydrogen atoms condensing out**.

Because the electrons and protons were now together as hydrogen atoms, fewer possible arrangements, this condensation represented a decrease in entropy and increase in order.

However, the energy released in this process carried away and spread out as photons, which represented at least as great an increase in entropy and decrease in order.

The same thing happens when water molecules **condense into snowflakes**.

Ice is a **more ordered** structure than water vapor, less way for H20 molecules to be spread out, analogous to the electron = proton = hydrogen condensation.

Same with chemical reactions, they are just a type of cooling, which is a dispersal of energy.

Example of **exothermic reaction**: the burning of hydrogen and oxygen gas. The two gases form H20, an exothermic reaction that releases heat.

Ex. $2H_{2} + O_{2} => 2H_{2}O + E$

Number of gas particles has decreased from 3 to 2, fewer gas particles means fewer ways to arrange them, decreasing entropy.

The electric field energy released when the bonds change goes into thermal energy of the water molecules and the environment. This increases entropy and is greater than the decrease from the particles decrease above. Therefore not entropy increases.

This reaction is like water to ice cooling,m except that the energy released is initially dispersed amongst the reaction products themselves and the environment.

Note: Like many chemical reactions, an activation energy, a spark, is required.

Chemical reactions do not happen because the energy in the bonds decrease. In endothermic reactions, energy must be supplied, and the energy in bonds increases.

Chemical reactions are driven by the dispersal of energy.

So assuming that life is just complex chemical reactions, could nature spontaneously create as products of chemical cooling, the complex structures (machinery) of life, from less structured reactants?

## Proteins

Recall: Amino acids are the building blocks of life. The human body uses 20 of them to construct proteins, the bulk of living stuff. The simplest amino acid is glycine.

The origin of amino acids on early Earth is not a big mystery (deep sea vents). The bigger question is how can amino acids spontaneously come together in the form of proteins?

Two steps:

* Amino acids link together in long chains.

* These chains coil and fold incomplex ways.

## Formation of Amino Acid Chains

Amino acids have two key parts:

1. An Amine group, $NH_{2}$
2. A COOH carboxylic acid group

Two amino acids join when the amine group in one approaches the acid group in the other, resulting in a peptide bond and the expulsion of a water molecule.

This **consumes energy** and is a big reason why we need to eat. But assuming we have a long chain of amino acids, a peptide chain, let's see how it coils.


## Coiling of an Amino Acid Chain into a Helix

The water molecule H20 is a **polar molecule**. Each H shares its electron with the O, making the protruding Hs positive. Also the O has four more unshared electrons, opposite the Hs, making the side of the O opposite the Hs negative.

This is a positive charge on one side of the Oxygen, and the other side negatively charged because of the unpaired electrons.

In liquid water, the positive Hs of one molecule attract the negative Os in neighbouring molecules. This **hydrogen bond** is stronger than van der Waals interaction, and weaker than covalent or ionic bonds, and is responsible for various magical properties of water that make it integral to life.

It's also responsible for the coiling of amino acid chains into the very important alpha helix.

The H attached to the N of one peptide bond hydrogen-bonds with the O attached to the C of a neighbouring peptide bond. This bond is strong enough to hold the helical structure in place.

The rigid alpha helix is a more ordered form of the amino acid chain than just a random, floppy, linear chain. How can this order arise **spontaneously**?

The O-H hydrogen bonds are sufficiently strong that, when they form, enough electrostatic field energy disperse into the environment that the resulting increase in disorder exceeds the increase in order of the alpha helix. The universe as a whole gets more **disordered**!

## Folding and Intertwining of Helices

**Hemoglobin molecules** making up 96% of the non-water in red blood cells, carry oxygen to all cells in the body.

Each molecule is made of two alpha and two beta helices, bent and twisted in such a way as to hold four heme groups.

Each heme group has one iron atom that oxygen binds to. Blood is red because iron oxide is rust.

The bending and twisting of the helices is not random at all, it is very precise, each red blood cell contains zillions of identical Hemoglobin moelcules. Hemoglobin is a highly ordered structure. Can such order emerge spontaneously?

Yes. For the same reason oil and water don't mix.

Why doesn't oil disperse in water like a drop of ink? Surely this would increase the entropy of the universe and so be spontaneous?

Why does it do the opposite and clump together after we try to mix it?

Hydrocarbons like oil are made of only C & H atoms, and are hydrophobic, when a hydrocarbon molecule is put in water, the surrounding polar water molecules interact withs its H atoms and form a highly structured cage around it. Like methane, CH4

The resulting increase in order by the caging everywhere would outweigh the decrease in order caused by the spreading out of the oil molecules, and their energy. Oil molecules clump together to show as few of themselves to the water as possible.

What does this have to do with these helices?

Many of the amino acids in the helices have hydrocarbon parts, and so behave like oil and are hydrophobic.

Water molecules would form intricate cages around any hydrocarbon parts sticking out into the surrounding water, increasing the order of the universe.

The helices fold in ways that tend to minimize exposure of hydrocarbon parts to the water, and therefore minimize order, and maximize disorder.

The same effect probably plays a role also in the four helices Intertwining hemoglobin.

The ordered chain has more structure, lower entropy, than the scattered amino acids it was made form. Thus, there must be a compensating disorder created elsewhere, How?

We eat, in part for the energy, but more importantly, we take in high quality, low entropy energy, and allow it to decay into low quality, high entropy energy which we expel as body heat and excrement.

This spontaneous order-to-disorder process drives non-spontaneous disorder-to-order process in our bodies.

Analogy:

Top picture: both masses will spontaneously fall.

Bottom Picture: When coupled together, the heavier mass will raise the lighter. A stronger spontaneous reaction can drive a weaker spontaneous reaction in the reverse direction.

How do we assess the **driving power** of a reaction?

What are the gears and wheels that couple life's chemical reactions?

Recall:

In heat engine, the spontaneous flow of thermal energy from hot to cold is harnessed to do useful work, W, which can be used to create structure and order. Order from disorder.

But not all of the thermal energy is converted into useful work. A minimum waste heat of unusable energy must be dumped into the environment to ensure that net entropy increases in the universe.

The amount of energy that is free to do work is called the **free energy**.

Josiah Gibbs (1839-1903), in Boltzmann's generation, was the first person to apply thermodynamics to chemistry a d hence make thermodynamics more readily applicable to life.

We can think of an exothermic chemical reaction as a heat source with total energy U at the temperature $T_{H}$. When the system liberates energy $Q_{H}$ its energy goes down by $-Q_{H}$ and its entropy is reduced.

In  order for this to happen spontaneously, a minimum waste heat must be dumped into the environment at temperature T, increasing its entropy by at least the same amount.

Like the heat engine, the free energy of the system goes down as it does work.

All chemical reactions spontaneously move towards **lower free energy**.

This is the driving power of the reaction: The greater the fall in free energy, the more usable energy, work, is liberated to create structure and order elsewhere.

This applies to all natural processes in the universe:

1. Systems do not spontaneously move to lower energy.

2. Systems spontaneously move to **lower free energy**

3. Systems fall **down** in free energy as the universe falls up in total **entropy**.

**So when we eat, we eat high order energy with low entropy, use it create higher order structures in our body, with less entropy, but give off lower free energy like heat and waste, which is greater entropy.**

## Bioenergetics coupled to Biosynthesis

Go from degradation of food couples to biosynthesis, linking amino acids.

Low entropy, high free energy reactants create high entropy, low free energy.
