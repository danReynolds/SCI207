# Mystery of Dark Energy

The missing mass-energy in the universe is called **Dark Energy**. Approximately 74% of missing mass-energy.

This claim that 74% of matter is dark energy is an extraordinary claim.

Is there any independent evidence for dark energy?

Yes: The accelerated expansion of the universe!

In 1998, observations were made of the expansion rate of space at different times in cosmic history, based on observations of distant **Type 1a Supernovae**. Explosions are super intense and extemely bright.

This data, apparent brightness and redshift, input into the mathematics of Einstein's cosmological model of the universe, gives a(t)

Recall: H(t) = a'(t) / a(t), a(t) = scale factor

Surprise: The rate at which space is expanding has recently started to speed up.

Expected:

Attractive gravitational force between ordinary matter slows down the expansion a(t), should increase with time more slowly.

## Summary

This requires a positive cosmological constant, or equivalently, some weird stuff called dark energy, with positive density and negative pressure.

The amount of mass density required to explain the accelerated expansion is exactly the amount of missing mass-energy required to explain CMB observation that space is flat, or nearly.

Recall that we're missing 3.7 hydrogen atoms per cubic meter. But, the amount that the dark energy would give is exactly 3.7 hydrogen atoms per cubic meter.

Thus despite how radical the idea was, it was accepted very quickly. The 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded jointly to two supernovae research groups led by:

* Saul Permutter
* Brian P. Schmidt


The actual value of the cosmological constant turns out to be relatively small and positive. This has profound implications for our existence:

* if it was much larger, than the universe would have expanded so fast that galaxies, stars, or even atoms could not have formed = no life
* if it were much larger and negative, the universe would have collapsed too soon for life to have evolved = no life
* it is relatively fine tuned to allow for the existence of life. Thus the question of our existence is intimately tied to why it has that value. Where does it come from?

## So What is Dark Energy?

* **It is dark**: Or invisible/transparent, we cannot see it. It doesn't appear to interact with matter or radiation (light) at all. We can see dark matter by its gravitational interaction with visible matter, not so for dark energy.
* **It is smoothly distributed**: It does not fall into galaxies or clusters (gravitationally clumped), or it would affect the dynamics of those objects (like dark matter does)
* **It is persistent**: It's density appears to remain constant even as space expands. It doesn't get less dense like ordinary and dark matter does, when space expands.

In short: Dark energy is not matter. Unlike matter, it appears to have no dynamics, and does not dilute as space expands. It is something else. Therefore we call it dark energy.

Best guess: Dark energy is vacuum energy

* Observations indicate the dark energy is at least approximately uniform

* But wait, doesn't this violate conservation of total energy?

Unknown! Remember, Einstein's theory of space, time and gravity threw a monkey wrench into our understanding of energy. We don't yet properly understand how to include gravitational energy so we don't really know if total energy is conserved or not, especially on a cosmic scale.

Certainly the energy of matter along, ignoring gravity is not always conserved. Example: the number of CMB photons is fixed, but as space expands, they get stretched to lower energy photons, so matter energy is lost. However, the matter still obeys what's called the energy-momentum conservation equation which includes the effects of the expanding space. Energy loss of photons is a clear prediction of general relativity that has been verified.

It can be argued that the decreasing CMB photon energy is no weirder than the increasing dark energy. Both happen because, in general relativity, spacetime itself is dynamic, and participates in how things evolve over time.

On the other hand, physicists sometimes talk about changes in negative gravitational energy (we make potential energies negative) compensating for changes in positive matter/radiation energy, but this is not completely understood. Rough arguments are even made that the total negative gravitational energy in the universe plus the total positive matter/radiation energy add up to simply zero. If true, the total energy of the universe is conserved, and adds up to exactly nothing! Then the universe could be nothing, just a different representation of zero!

Imagine a cylinder filled with a gas at negative pressure (analogous to the negative pressure of dark energy). This will tend to pull in the piston. If we do work to pull it out, we add positive energy to the gas, like stretching an elastic band (analogous to more dark energy appearing as space expands, which is how it maintains constant density)

So increasing dark energy and negative dark pressure work together to make sense. But what is pulling the piston out? It comes from Einstein's equations, so it all works out. Negative pressure drives positive accelerated expansion! It seems weird only because we don't have experience with it.

Before physics discovered quantum mechanics (more later...) we would have said that the vacuum is empty.

But the quantum nature of the universe says that the vacuum is teeming with activity in the form of **spontaneous creation and annihiliation** of virtual particle-antiparticle pairs called quantum vacuum fluctuations.

This does not violate conservation of energy, it just means the vacuum ahs energy that is greater than zero.

How can empty space have energy?

Example: Particle in one-dimensional box of length L. A is the classical behaviour, B-F are examples of the particle behaving like a wave (quantum behavior)

Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle: The momentum of a particle is uncertain, it cannot have a certain value like 0. This it cannot have zero energy. The lowest possible energy is > 0.

This weird consequence of quantum nature of our universe can be accurately observed in the lab:

* Casimir Effect
* Lamb Shift
* Anomalous magnetic dipole moment of the electron, most accurately predicted and experimentally confirmed quantity ever

Also responsible for Hawking Radiation.

## Can Such Vacuum Energy by Dark Energy?

The vacuum energy of quantum fields has exactly the right form to be the cosmological constant, or dark energy:

**But** the vacuum energy is much, much larger than it should be for dark energy and this is the **Cosmological constant problem**.

Maybe we just were bad at predicting the amount of energy for dark energy, but so far, looks wrong!

In order to get a valid prediction, we need a deeper understanding of the universe that properly incorporates both its quantum and gravitational nature. We need a theory of quantum gravity, or more generally, a **theory of everything**.

Despite its uncertain origin, vacuum energy and the cosmological constant is the leading candidate for what dark energy might be. If so, the expansion of space will continue to accelerate, after a trillion years, our observable universe will contain essentially just the Milky Way and Andromeda, **more distance galaxies will be receding faster than the speed of light**.

Ultimate fate of the universe would be a **Big Freeze**, essentially heat death.

In 1-100 trillion years, gas to fuel stars will be exhausted and the universe will grow dark.

Most matter will coalesce in BHs (by 10^40 years), which will evaporate in Hawking radiation by 10^100 years, redshift to zero.

## Another possible answer: Dark Energy = Quintessence

Maybe dark energy is a dynamic field, like the electromagnetic field, except unlike the electromagnetic field, it does not arise from localized sources and pervades all of space uniformly.

Named after the fifth classical element, beyond earth, fire, water and air. It was believed to fill all space in the heavens, what the gods breathed.

Dynamic means it can change with time, thus changing the rate at which the expansion of space is accelerating. Its strength could change over cosmic time.

If dark energy is quintessence the fate of the universe depends on its unknown dynamics.

If its strength decreases and eventually changes direction, we get the Big Crunch.

If its strength increases enough, we get the Big Rip.

So the nature of dark energy is important because it controls the ultimate fate of the universe. The universe was originally dominated radiation, then later matter dark and ordinary and now dark energy. The first two dilute as space expands, presently the dark energy is left to dominate since it doesn't lose density.

If dark energy is quintessence, in the Big Rip scenario the accelerated rate of expansion of space can be so large that it rips apart first galaxy clusters, the galaxies, planets, atoms, everything!

## How?

If space is expanding, why aren't people expanding, planets expanding, etc.

Details in slides.

## Dark Energy Alternative

There is no dark energy, it's just gravity.

The expansion of space is certainly accelerating: getting faster and faster. Two completely independent lines of evidence point to the same thing: Type 1a supernovae measurements, discussed earlier, and rate of galaxy clustering.

But just as there may be no dark matter, the observations might instead be explained by a modified theory of gravity, maybe there is no dark energy.

If there is no dark energy, and its just gravity behaving in an unexpected way, then we don't know what the future holds.

## Summary

No one knows what dark energy is, but very active research continues. Main question: is the dark energy density really constant, or has it changed over cosmic time?

Dark energy is a major unsolved mystery of huge importance in the bigger picture.

While the CMB provides strong evidence for a hot, dense beginning, afterglow of the BB, it raises two deep mysteries which provide profound clues to our ultimate origin:

* Why is the temperature of the CMB almost perfectly uniform?
* Why is it not perfectly uniform? What is the origin of the tiny temperature fluctuations?

Average temperature: 2.7260 += 0.0013K

Temperature fluctuations: 1 part in 100,0000
