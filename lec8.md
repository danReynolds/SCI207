# Exoplanets

Main sequence stars: Stably fusing H to He

**Blue Giants**: Bright and high mass -> supernova. Least abundant and too short-lived to likely evolve.

**Red Dwarfs**: Dim and low mass -> longest-lived and most abundant, but brightness variable and planet must be close -> tidal heading and tidal locking. Feasibility for life is currently debatable.

**Giants**: Stars in transition state or death throes.

**White Dwarfs**: End of 97% of stars including Sun, heavier stars end as **neutron star** or **black hole**.

Sun like stars are just right.

## Detecting Exoplanets

**Doppler Method**: Planet and star orbit center of mass, star wobbles, detect periodic shift in spectrum of starlight, color of the light. Gives **mass** of planet and period, orbital distance by Kepler's Third Law. Best for high mass planets close to their star. When the planet absorbs wavelengths of light, you can tell by patterns of absorption what atoms the light must have hit, so we can see that there is a hydrogen pattern in the spectrum you receive from the star, and you can know that there was hydrogen in a spot of the star that there shouldn't have been, it might be a planet.

This gives the mass of the planet, and period. Now you know if the planet is too close for liquid water or too far, and have an estimate of its potential to support life.

If there are multiple planets, you would see a superimposed pattern of waves, and you need to analyze it into its two components.

**Transit Method**: Requires an edge-on view (probability about 1 in 200). Planet in front of star -> reduced visible light -> planet **size**.

Planet behind star -> reduced infrared light -> planet temperature, because there is infrared light, heat, coming from the planet. When it is behind the star, less infrared light observed, so know that
there is a planet.

Can also get some info about chemicals in the atmosphere.

Can detect also small mass, Earth-like planets.

Planet passes in front and the amount of light in front of the star temporarily dims, so we watch a star and when we see this happen, it could be a planet.

The time between the first dip and the second dip is the time it takes the planet to rotate around the star, which similarly by Kepler's Third Law allows you to determine the distance of the planet from the star, telling you if it is in the Goldilocks Zone.

## Kepler Mission

Uses the transit method, 145000 main-sequence stars, imaged every 30 minutes to detect brightness changes. As of July 2015, candidate planets = 4696, confirmed planets = 1030. It took pictures of the stars every 30 minutes, analyzing for differences in visible or infrared light.

Combine both the **Doppler** and **Transit** methods:

Planet **mass** from Doppler.
Planet **size** from Transit.

Gives planet average density:

* rocky
* gaseous
* other

Can learn if it is as dense as a water filled planet, or if even more less dense, it is a gas giant, etc.

Latest on search for **habitable planets**.

Twelve exoplanet discoveries from Kepler that are less than twice the size of Earth and reside in the **habitable zone** of their host star. G stars are Sun-like, K and M are smaller and coolers.

Dec 2011: Kepler 20-e, first planet smaller than Earth, orbits a star slightly cooler and smaller than our Sun every six days. But it is scorching hot and unable to maintain an atmosphere or a liquid water ocean.

Dec 2011: Kepler 22-b first planet in the **habitable zone** of a sun-like star, but it is more than twice the size of Earth and unlikely to have a solid surface. Water world.

April 2014: Kepler 186f is the **first Earth-size planet** found in the **habitable zone** of a small, cool M star.

Kepler 452b:

Found 1400 light years away in the constellation Cygnus. First near Earth-size planet in the habitable zone around a Sun-like star.

385-day orbit, Mass and composition unknown, but small size suggests rocky planet.

60% larger than Earth.

Spent 6 billion years in the habitable zone of its star, longer than Earth. Substantial opportunity for life to arise.

Exoplanet exploration is a **rapidly developing field**.

Brian Cox:

> There are billions of habitable Earth-like worlds out there in the galaxy and yet we are alone. There are billions of habitable Earth-like worlds out there in the galaxy and we are not alone. There are others. Of these statements is true.

The question *Are we Alone?* is of ever increasing interest to scientists.

## Biology is Universal

1. Everywhere we look in the universe, the **laws of physics are the same**.

Everywhere means both in space and time. All across the vast space of the observable universe, and back to almost the beginning of time.

Similar galaxies sprinkled throughout space. Same chemicals in the stars, gas, and dust. Same stellar processes, same gravity, etc.

Newton's unification of the heavens and the Earth has been vastly extended:

It appears that all the laws are tied together.

Biology is rooted in chemistry, and chemistry is rooted in physics.

Thus biology is ultimately rooted in physics. It is ultimately the laws of physics that allow or disallow life to emerge in the universe. Even tiny changes in certain particle masses or interactino strengths would result in **very** different universes, most of which could not have life.

Thus, if the physics of our universe allowed life to emerge on the Earth, there is no reason to believe that under similar conditions, life could not emerge on other exoplanets orbiting Sun-like stars in their habitable zone.

2. Organic molecules form easily and are widespread throughout the universe.

The Big Bang created mainly 75% **hydrogen** and 25% **helium** through thermonuclear fusion within the first three minutes.

The heavier elements up to **iron**, **carbon**, **oxygen**, **silicon**, etc are forged by thermonuclear fusion in the cores of stars:

All low to medium mass stars including the Sun enter a red giant phase late in life. Strong stellar winds and thermal pulses dredge up the carbon and oxygen in the core, sloughing off 50-70% of the star's mass.

About 1/6 are carbon stars, that are especially rich and sources of sooty, carbon compounds.

This dust significantly enriches the mainly H and He interstellar medium, collapsing into more stars and planets.

Elements heavier than iron, like uranium, are formed in shockwave induced nuclear fusion and rapid neutron capture in stellar supernovae.

**Organic molecules** form in dusty interstellar clouds and rain down on planets.

This was a **surprise**, no one expected chemical reactions in cold, diffuse gas.

One idea: Nearby stars provide energy for chemical reactions on the surface of cosmic dust grains, tiny pieces of solid particles composed mainly of carbon, silicon, and oxygen.

Another idea: Cosmic rays ionize atoms

Early discoveries:

Formadelyhyde, vinyl alcohol, iso-propyl cyanide.

So far we do not have the sensitivity to detect the signals from amino acids, the interstellar chemistry seems to be able to form these amino acids but at the moment we lack the evidence.

After the Big Bang, some scientists like Avi Loeb has suggested that the chemistry of life may have begun shortly after the Big Bang, during a **habitable epoch** when the universe was only 10-17 million years old, and there weren't any stars yet, a time called the *Dark Ages*.

**Organic molecules** form in dusty interstellar clouds and rain down on planets.

The organic molecules, possibly including amino acids, make their way into **meteorites**, which rain down on planets.

Example: Murchison meteorites contains common amino acids such as glycine, alanine, and glutamic acid as well as unusual ones like isovaline.

Organic molecules are created on Earth:

**Energy Sources**: Impact shocks, volcanic activity, UV light, lightning, etc recall famous Miller-Urey experiment.

**In deep-sea hydrothermal vents**: Everett Shock, NASA astrobiology, there is an enormous thermodynamic drive to form organic compounds as seawater and hydrothermal fluids which are far from equilibrium, mix and move towards a stable state.

The drive is maximized around 100-150C, precisely the temperatures at which hyperthermophilic bacteria and thermoacidophilic archaea have been found, at the base of the phylogenetic tree of life closest to the Last Universal Common Ancestor.

3. Life on Earth arose almost immediatley after the right conditions emerged. The Late Heavy Bombardment ended about 3.8 BYA, and life emerged almost immediately after this.

This suggests the transition from chemistry to biology is not especially difficult, and quite possibly life would emerge just as quickly on other worlds in similar conditions.

Remember: We have increasingly plausible origin scenarios for life on Earth.

Also, **life is robust**:

Life quickly bounced back after five mass extinction events in the last 500 million years.

Life can exist in surprisingly extreme conditions, extraordinary hot, acidic, alkaline, dry, high pressure in rocks many km underground. Significantly increases the chances of finding exoplanets, and also elsewhere in the Solar System.

We have no reason to think that life ought to be rare in the universe, and several reasons to expect it might be quite common.

Everywhere we have looked in the universe, the **laws of physics are the same**.

**Organic molecules form easily**, and are widespread throughout the universe.

**Life on Earth arose almost immediately** after the right conditions, emerged, and can survive under a wide range of extreme conditions.

* On Planets and moons in our own solar system, using robot space probe tech.

## Right Conditons

Life on Earth uses 25 of the 92 naturally occurring chemical elements. Hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, make up ~96% of mass of living organisms. Ignore He, chemically inert, these are the most abundance elements in the universe.

big Bang produced mostly H and He, stars produced the carbon, oxygen and nitrogen.

Relative abundances of elements on Earth's surface:

Recall H, O, C, N make up 96% of the mass of living organisms.

Mere coincidence that life uses the most abundant elements?

Also need a solvent, liquid or gas.

All life on Earth requires liquid water, to dissolve molecules so that they can interact.

Water is needed to:

1. Dissolve organic and inorganic molecules, making them available for hcemi9cal reactions
2. Transport chemicals into and out of cells
3. Directly involved in many metabolic reactions

Water is special because:

* It remains liquid over a relatively wide and high range of temperatures
* Ice floats, so oceans do not freeze solid

Other liquids where life could exist:

Sulfuric Acid, Methane, Ethane.

Gas solvent:

An atmosphere can also facilitate chemical mixing and interactions; it can also be part of an organism's metabolism, O2, CO2 in Earth's atmosphere.

Atmospheres and oceans also protect organic molecules that tend to be broken down by a star's radiation (UV light) or high energy particles from space (cosmic rays)

Titan, Saturn's largest moon, has a dense nitrogen-rich atmosphere like Earth with methane clouds and lakes of liquid ethane.
