## Evolution of the Universe

Where do we come from? Parents, grandparents, fish, LUCA, ... Evolution?

How did the universe evolve to support complex life?

Some possibilities regarding evolution of the universe:

Universe is **static** and **eternal** (no beginning or end):

Articulated clearly by Giordano Bruno in 1584.

The universe is then one infinite, immobile, it is not capable of comprehension and therefore is endless and limitless.

First to image an infinite universe filled with stars each with their own planets, and no center to the universe.

Also wrote: Other worlds have no less virtue nor a nature different to that of our Earth, and like Earth contain animals and inhabitants.

**Cosmology** as a science began in the early 20th century with the advent of Einstein's **general theory of relativity**, a geometrical theory of space, time, and gravity.

1917: Einstein applied his new theory to cosmology. Worried about imposing ad hoc boundary conditions at infinity, so postulated space is finite but unbounded: the 3D analogue of a 2D sphere.

Believed universe was static -> displayed that his theory predicted the universe must expand or contract -> introduced his famous cosmological constant to force it to be static. Was later realized model was unstable: small perturbation -> expand or contract

Universe is dynamic:

1912: Vesto Slipher measured the redshift of spiral nebulae and interpretted this redshift as a Doppler shift: the spiral nebuale were all moving away from us -> something dynamic.

But he didn't know their extreme distance - that the spiral nebulae were separate galaxies outside of our own and so didn't fully appreciate the cosmic significance of this discovery.

1924: Alexander Friedmann fully understood the cosmological implications of Einstein's general relativity, including that space is **dynamic**, necessarily expands or contracts and that space can have three types of large-scale geometry: open (negative curvature), flat (zero curvature), closed (positive curvature) - the case Einstein considered.

1927: Georges Lemaitre: Independently derived Friedmann's solutions and knowing about the the redshift of the spiral nebulae, speculated that the universe began with the explosion of the primeval atom (The Big Bang)

1929: Edwin Hubble measured the distances to the receding spiral nebulae using Cepheid variable stars and discovered that they were not nebulae in our own galaxy, but are actually separate galaxies outside of our own. A universe of galaxies!

Using redshift data, he determined that more distance galaxies appear to be receding faster (Hubble's Law). The Universe is expanding, this is most easily explained by Einstein's theory, which says that space can expand.

The further out things are from us, the faster they are moving away, the greater the redshift.

How can expanding space explain redshift?

Light waves are stretched to longer wavelengths as they travel through expanding space.

Suppose a galaxy emits blue light, moving to another galaxy. As it crawls through space, it could take like 2.5 million years to get from Andromeda to Milky Way. During that time, space is expanding. Expanding space stretches photons. As it travels, it is stretched to a longer wavelength, making red light from blue light.

The galaxies are not moving, the amount of space between them grows.

**Hubble's Law**: Apparent recessional velocity $V = H_{0}d,H_{0}$~ 70 km/s per Mega parsec (parsec = ~3 light years)

Exception for small *peculiar velocities*, galaxies don't move. The space they are floating in simply expands, increasing the distance between them, like coins glued to an expanding balloon. The galaxies themselves don't expand, since they are gravitationally bound to eachother.

Galaxies don't move. Space expands. The expansion has no center.

Old Hubble Law: galaxies moving away from us with some recessional velocity proportional to their distance, 70km/s per mega parsec

New Hubble law: galaxies don't move, space expands, H(t) = a(t) / b(t) where b(t) = scale factor of space = size of space relative to the present

A galaxy doesn't expand within itself, just space between galaxies. The gravitational forces are too strong for the expansion of space to cause say your house and another house to expand from eachother over time. so The things within the galaxy aren't getting further apart, but the space between galaxies is expanding. The expansion of space within our solar system is super slow.

**Important: All of space has been uniformly filled with matter and radiation**.

Since the early universe there has been much gravitational clumping into stars and galaxies, but on average, over big enough scales, it is still uniform.

**The Big Bang was not a dense point of stuff that exploded into an otherwise empty space. Stuff was dense everywhere, and space expanded everywhere, diluting the stuff everywhere. Also the observable univeerseis just a small part of all of space. The size of all of space is not known.**

The density of all of space is basically uniform at large enough scales.

## Sky is Dark At Night

Go back to Giordano Bruno (1584):

> The universe is then one, infinite, immobile... It is not capable of comprehension and therefore is endless and limitless.

Make the following assumptions:

* Universe is static
* Universe is infinitely big
* Stars (or today, galaxies of stars) are evenly scattered throughout (Copernican Principle)
* Universe is infinitely old

But wait: Aren't far away stars dimmer? Yes but their surface brightness is independent of their distance. 4 suns twice as far away are the same total amount of light as 1 sun and there are so many of them. So how come the whole sky isn't bright?

One of the assumptions must be wrong.

Darkness of sky strongly suggests universe is dynamic and had a beginning. An expanding universe implies a beginning. If you wait long enough, all lights will turn on because stars will eventually have their light reach earth, and they'd all turn on.

Also, redshift causes some of the visible light from stars to go infrared and we can't see it.

So both the finite age of the universe and the redshift from universe expansion causes the night sky.
