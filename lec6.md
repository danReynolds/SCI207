## The Gears of Biosynthesis

The gears of biosynthesis are **highly complex, microscopic machines.**

How could they possibly arise spontaneously?

Humans: glucose + oxygen -> carbon dioxide + water + energy

Plants: Light energy, highly ordered, low entropy form of energy is taken in by plant, which combines it with carbon dioxide to produce glucose, oxygen.


Humans take a molecule called ADP, adenosine diphosphate, and create ATP, adenosine triphosphate. We take the energy from the food, ADP, and create ATP, which is energy for cells. Produces carbon dixode and water.

This is a spontaneous process that increases the entropy of the universe.

ATP reacts to form amino acid chains.

Random amino acids react to form ADP.

ADP & ATP are the life bloods of bioenergics.

The energetic charging of ADP to ATP is done by an electrochemical battery.

Example of electrochemical battery:

1. Drop a cube of iron, Fe, into a copper, Cu, sulfate solution.
2. The Cu 2+ ions in the water have a strong affinity for electrons.
3. The Fe atoms become Fe 2+ ions in solution and the Cu 2+ ions become neutral Cu atoms that deposit on the cube.

Net result: The copper precipitates and the iron dissolves.

This is a spontaneous reaction, happens on its own. The spontaneous flow of electrons from Fe atoms to the Cu 2+ ions is in random directions.

What if we force the electrons to flow in one direction only?

Electric current opposite electron flow can be used to do work.

Connect plate of copper and iron each in solutions divided by a wall by a copper wire. The electrons flow from the iron to the copper, iron dissolves, copper precipitates, and since the electrons flow through the copper wire, get a current running in the opposite direction of the electron flow.

**Nature has evolved a similar battery, in which glucose and oxygen are burned to charge ADP to ATP.**

Like Cu 2+ ions, oxygen has a strong affinity for electrons, it likes to become O 2-.

Glucose gets snipped into two pyruvate ions:

Which can easily give up their extra electron and two protons, H+ ions, are produced.

The spontaneous flow of electrons from pyruvate to oxygen, the burning of sugar, **does the work to charge ADP to ATP**. The ATP have higher order, lower entropy than the ADP, but as with everything else, the net entropy of the universe goes up.

The pyruvate falls apart  into carbon dioxide, we exhale, and each O 2- picks up the two protons to become water.

So goes from positive pyruvate ions to oxygen which want the electrons and become negative. This is the electron flow producing current in our bodies.

The spontaneous flow of electrons does not directly charge the ADP to ATP. Instead:

1. It drives proton pump that forces protons across a membrane.
2. This creates a proton gradient that stores the potential energy across the membrane in an electric field
3. This store of energy can be tapped by allowing protons to flow back across the membrane through a protein called ATP synthase. The electric field accelerates the protons, and this extra kinetic energy is used to charge ADP to ATP.

All of this takes place in mitochondria inside cells.

## The Proton Gradient

The **proton gradient** creates an electric field that accelerates the protons back across the membrane.

These accelerated protons push on a rotary mechanical motor, which converts ADP to ATP (it's a physical machine, now what one usually thinks of as chemistry).

About 3 protons need to pass through to charge one ATP, 100 charges per second.

ADP enters the machine which has stored mechanical energy from the rotor, changing ADP into ATP.

This machine has many components like a rotary engine. A rotor, a drive shaft, etc.

Are we just some computer made by advanced lifeforms?

## Gradients

Today all energy that living organisms use ultimately comes from generating and tapping a proton or other ion gradient.

It is the universal battery that powers all life on Earth, as universal as the genetic code itself. Thus it is an important clue to the **origin of life**.

In eukaryotes like us, this proton gradient battery is inside mitochondria. The mitochondria across all eukaryotes have the same general structure.

These bacteria-sized organelles may have originally been aerobic bateria that invaded and colonized early eukaryotic cells. They have an independent bacteria-like genome.

Okay, so ion gradients are the universal battery of life. But this raises a severe evolutionary chicken and egg problem:

* Proteins are used to generate and tap ion gradients, the ATP synthase is used to tap the proton gradient and convert ADP to ATP.
* But energy is needed to build proteins like ATP synthase in the first place, protein synthesis consumes 75% of a cell's ATP budget.

**Proteins are required to generate energy, but energy is needed to build those proteins. So where did we get the energy to form that first proteins?**

Naturally occurring protein gradients may the be the answer.

Rocks of deep-sea thermal vents contain labyrinths of tiny think-walled pores which could have acted as **proto-cells**, the first life forms.

CO2 and H+ rich ocean water on the outside and H2 and OH- rich alkaline vent water on the inside, separate by thin material like iron sulfide wall, sets up a natural proton gradient of magnitude and orientation used by modern cells.

Powered by the proton gradient, the FeS wall can catalyse conversion of CO2 and H2 into organic carbon-containing molecules, and concentrate them inside, enabling them eventually to generate genes, proteins and a proto-membrane.

The spark of life could have been this natural proton gradient.

Some details are show in diagrams A and B:

A. In the presence of the proton gradient, FeS catalyzes CO2 + H2 -> Carbon + Energy. Note: Modern microbes near vents that similarly live off CO2 and H2 use enzymes, protein catalysts, also based on FeS and FeNiS, a hint this may be right.

B. The carbon, plus this relatively low entropy energy inside the protocell allows the formation of complex organic carbon structures like amino acids, RNA bases, sugars, lipids and possibly event ATP synthase. A very efficient coupling to the proton gradient.

Note that H+ acid passing through the ATP synthase is neutralized by continuous supply of OH base in the vent water.

Such proto cells could tap the naturally occurring proton gradient, but how could they evolve to generate their own gradient and become free living cells, floating around in the ocean? They are all tied to the natural proton gradient.

Three things would be needed:

1. A completely sealed organic cell wall to replace the FeS rock wall.
2. A proton pump to pump out the protons that enter through the ATP synthase which are no longer neutralized by vent water OH-
3. An energy source to drive the pump. In our cells we eat sugar and oxygen, taking that electron flow to drive the proton pump.

Idea: The FeS wall was leaky to H+ ions, reducing efficiency. Lipids, fats, may have naturally formed an organic cell wall which would prevent this leakage.

C. Assuming the evolving organic cell wall tightened up slowly was first impermeable to large ions like Na+, then to small ions like H+ protons , there would have been a long transition time during which a NA+ gradient would have been more efficient than a H+ gradient. This could explain why modern vent microbes have a very simple Na+/H+ antiporter which runs for free, converting H+ bioenergetics to NA+ bioenergetics. In such a transition-stage proto-cell, the natural proton gradient is still used H+ passing through the antiporter is still neutralized by the continuous supply of OH- in the vent water.

This suggests a plausible path to an organic cell wall and a NA+ pump. What drives it? Just switch from proton gradient to energy from metabolizing CO2 + H2. The newly living cell could then detach from the rock and become a free-livivng cell floating in the ocean.

## Summary

We may never be certain how life on Earth began. The further back we push the question, the less direct evidence survives. Nevertheless, science is making stunning progress towards an answer.

## The Real Question

All of these scenarios rely on complex machine like ATP synthase, protein synthesis machinery, DNA replication machinery, etc.

So the REAL QUESTION is:

How might such complex machinery have arisen spontaneously?

1. 1st Law: Quantity of energy is constant
2. 2nd Law: Quality of energy continually decreases

We have show that life is consistent with these basic thermodynamics laws.

The problem is, thermodynamics was originally the study of closed systems at or near equilibrium. But living organisms are:

* NOT closed systems, they exchange matter and energy with their environment.
* NOT in equilibrium, they are continually changing, animated, not static.

Lane: Cells require dynamic disequilibrium, that is what being alive is all about.

## Dissipative Structures

Late 60s-70s, Illya Prigogine discovered dissipative structures in systems that are:

* **Open**: They have energy or matter flowing through them
* **Non-Equilibrium**: Steady state, but not static flow = motion

Ex. Boiling water, or other convection cell structures.

Energy flows through the system Qin = Qout

But Temp in > Temp out, therefore entrop increase of the cold sink is greater than the entropy decrease of the hot source:

Entropy of universe is increasing.

Energy is first carried by conduction. But above a critical temperature, convection sets in, Non-Equilibrium, an ordered struture of Benard cells spontaneously appear:

This ordered structure increases the energy flow and dissipation rate, increasing entropy generation rate.

This allows the system to be in a state of lower entropy, more ordered form of cells.

Energy must continually flow and be dissipated, degraded, when it stops, the structure dies.

We eat food, which goes out as lower form energy and we maintain our structure. This process above is analogous to a living organism:

* An open system with energy/matter flowing through it, sunlight, food etc, operating out of thermodynamic equilibrium.

* Energy in (sunlight, food) = Energy out.

* Dissipative structures are related to self-organizing systems: Order arises out of the local interactions between smaller component parts of an initially disordered system.

Many examples of this general phenomenon:

* Physics: Spontaneous magnetization, atoms become oriented in certain direction
* Chemistry: Oscillating and reaction-diffusion reactions
* Biology: Birds flocking, fish schooling, etc.

## Deeper Understanding of the Second Law

* 1994 Denis Evans and Debra Searles proved:

* The 2nd Law is not strictly true. In microscopic systems, the entropy of an isolated system can fluctuate, mostly increasing, but sometimes decreasing. This has been observed in experiments.

Roughly speaking, the **fluctuation theorem** states:

S is entropy.

$\frac{+S}{-S} = e^{S}$

In words, small fluctuations are equally likely to be positive or negative.

large fluctuations are almost always positive.

In 1999, Gavin Crooks proved a generalization of the fluctuation theorem:

2013-2015 Jeremy England a biophysicist at MIT has applied the above to living organisms. Not just closed systems.

In doing so, England may be close to answering the question of *why is there life*?
