# Life Movie

Dragonfly - brief, very energetic life

They can pull 2.5 G in a turn, fly 15mph.

Been around since time of dinosaurs.

## What is Life?

Phillipines: Place where mountain spirits give us life, soul returns to mountains after.

Spirits of the dead walk among the living.

Spirituality has been used to explain life and death, and only now is science beginning to answer them:

## Schrodinger

Gave a lecture on *What is Life*, he says that it isn't mystical, life is a process, an interaction of matter.

## 1st Law of Thermodynamics

Energy is not created or destroyed.

First life might have exploited energy from natural proton waterfalls.

Hydrothermal vent system. Life had begun in such structures, because they are alkaline vents, alkaline vents hit ancient acidic seawater, vents don't just provide an energy source, they are rich in raw materials life needs like hydrogen gas, CO2 and minerals like iron, nickel, sulfur.

A place like those vents could be where life on Earth began.

The first living things might have started out as parts of the rock.

Living things still get their energy using these proton gradients.

The spark of life is proton gradients.

## Golden JellyFish

Used to live like most jellyfish, catching zooplankton in their tentacles, but today have evolved to not need tentacles.

They photosynthesize.

Every morning, they swim towards the East, tracking the sun across the sky.

The trapped sunlight is converted into chemical energy, combining water and carbon dioxide to produce glucose. Glucose and other molecules provide energy.

## Universe

Gradually cooling until absolute zero. Then everything decays away.

You have to export more disorder than order you import. There is more entropy being generated.

## DNA

Has stability and resistance to change. Genetic code, the enzymes that copy, make only 1 mistake in a billion.

That makes adaptation faithfully transmitted.

## What is Life?

A collection of chemical processes, transmitted through DNA. The origins of that chemistry can be traced back to vents in the ocean.

The emergence of life on Earth might have been an inevitable consequence of physics.
