# Eternal Inflation and Multiverse

Imagine that space is infinite and eternal. Assuming inflation can occur at all, it may occur at different rates in different places and shut off after different amounts of time.

All of space could be eternally inflating, and randomly shutting off in pockets. Bubble universes. These universes may have very different, randomly determined properties.

Are we just one bubble in such a multiverse?

Is this the explanation for a cosmological constant problem and other fine tuning problems?

Will a theory of everything explain more?

## Final Chapter: Everything

What is the ultimate origin of the free energy that life uses today?

Can we trace this free energy through ever lower entropy sources back to the Big Bang?

Why did the Big Bang result in an early universe in such a relatively low entropy state?

Evolution of the Universe in Broad Brushstrokes:

The matter of the early universe was hot and dense, and filled all of space almost perfectly uniformly. There was no structure.

As space expanded, the matter cooled and condensed:

* Quarks are the particles that make up protons and neutrons
* Quark-gluon plasma cooled and condensed into protons and neutrons
* Protons and neutrons cooled and condensed into light
* light nuclei and electrons cooled and condensed into H and He atoms (CMB)
* Neutral H and He gas cooled and condensed gravitationally into the first stars
* Stars gravitationally clumped into galaxies, clusters of galaxies, etc

Like snowflakes, condensing out of a cooling cloud of water vapour, each represents a spontaneous creation of structure, or order.

Problem:

The early universe seems to have been in a state of thermodynamic equilibrium (a gas of particles with uniform temperature and density), and thus maximum entropy since thermodynamic equilibrium is the definition of max entropy.

The present universe is certainly not in thermodynamic equilibrium: there are all kinds of local gradients (temperature, density, chemical, etc) and flows. How did it get out of equilibrium which is a necessary prerequisite for life to exist?

Isn't starting in a state of max entropy a blatant violation of the Second law of thermodynamics? Surely the early universe must have been in a state of minimum or low entropy so that the entropy could increase as it evolved in the process of producing stars, planets etc?

## Role of Gravity

Gravity plays key roles in solving these problems:

* **Expansion of Space**: Caused the universe to come out of equilibrium; it increased the ceiling of max entropy, allowing room for entropy to increase
* **Gravitational Clumping**: Generates gradients and structure and is a catalyst that facilitates entropy-increasing processes essential for life, like fusion of stars
* **Black Holes**: Contain almost all of the entropy of the universe today

Equilibrium means that everything is static. Bit if space is expanding, density and temperature are changing, decreasing, what does this mean for equilibrium?

Imagine a gas in a cylinder with a piston:

* If we pull the piston out slowly, compared to the time it takes the gas atoms to adjust through a sequence of slowly-changing equilibrium states, the gas remains in instantaneous equilibrium. Entropy remains constant; process is reversible.

This was happening in the very early universe. The expansion, after inflation, was slow compared to the time it took for the elementary particles to adjust to new instantaneous equilibrium states.

For example, the process: Quark-gluon plasma -> protons and neutrons is constant entropy and reversible, just reverse the expansion!

But if we pull it out quickly, the gas will get out of equilibrium, no time to adjust, there will be gradients that dissipate. Entropy increases, the process is irreversible.

This was happening later in the early universe, during nucleosynthesis: If the universe stayed the same size and temperature during nucleosynthesis, then all of the hydrogen would have had time to fuse into iron. But the expansion was too fast for this, fusion too slow, and it only got part way through the fusion, 25% He, leaving the 75% H before the temperature and density dropped too low to continue.

This had profound consequences:

It left the H and He gas out of equilibrium. By the Second Law, it would love to move toward equilibrium by fusing into iron, thereby generating tons of energy that would disperse as KE of particles and light, hugely increasing the entropy of the universe. But it couldn't. Expansion made the conditions no longer right for fusion.

The expansion of space increased the ceiling of max entropy. The universe left the H and He with a huge potential to generate energy and entropy, a huge amount of free energy. This is the source of all of the free energy, of ordinary matter at least, in the universe. We can trace this back one more step to baryogenesis, when all the baryons annihilated with the antibaryons, flooding the universe with light, except there was a slight, mysterious imbalance that left a few baryons after the annihilation. This trace amount of baryons is all the matter that makes up the universe today.

This had profound consequences:

There was no free energy in the universe until the universe was driven out of thermodynamic equilibrium by the expansion of space.

This had profound consequences:

* So H and He are the oldest and most abundant fossil fuels in the universe
* Gravitational collapse creates the right conditions in stars to release this energy via fusion. This powers all phototrophic life.
* If we could create the right conditions here on Earth in artificial stars, it could end the world's energy problems forever in one fell swoop.

We can't use gravitational forces, we'd need enough matter as in a star, which allows it to do fusion, so we need to use strong magnetic fields, heating the protons sufficiently.

**Fission**: Take a large atomic nucleus like uranium, fire a neutron at it, split the atomic nucleus, releasing energy. Problem with fission reactors is that they can get out of control, get a meltdown. They don't have to have meltdowns, you can build very safe ones, it was for political reasons they weren't built to best safety specs.
**Fusion**: Take two smaller nuclei like protons and fusing them together to make larger nuclei like helium. This process is safer, can't have runaway problems like with fission. Harder to achieve, if anything goes wrong with confinement, it just fizzles out rather than fission runaway.

* Gravitational clumping lowers entropy locally, creating more ordered structures.

Rough argument:

Imagine a cloud of gas particles floating in space.

As the cloud gravitationally collapses, the particles occupy less volume -> fewer possible ways to arrange their positions (small number of microstates) -> entropy decreases. More ordered.

But wait: as the cloud collapses, gravitational PE -> KE. There is more KE to distribute amongst the particles -> more ways to do so (larger number of microstates) -> entropy increases, less ordered.

Competing effects: which wins? Decreasing volume -> **still net local lowering of entropy despite KE.**.

But every local decrease in entropy requires a compensating increase in entropy elsewhere, so that the total entropy of the universe increases or stays the same.

Where is the compensating increase in entropy happening?

Gravitational PE -> KE -> Thermal energy via collisions = Thermal radiation. The cloud heats up and glows, radiating thermal photons, plus gravitons, into the surrounding space.

Like thermal photons radiated from Earth into space, allowing creation of all the low entropy, ordered, structures on Earth (hurricanes, light etc), the thermal photons radiated by the cloud increase the entropy of the surrounding universe more than the entropy of the cloud decreased during gravitational collapse. Entropy increases and is irreversible!

Note: The way that gravity binds particles together is peculiar.

As the cloud gravitationally collapses, it loses energy by radiating thermal energy.

Nevertheless, the core of the cloud still heats up, gets hotter as it collapses.

The less energy it has, the hotter it gets. It heats up enough to spark thermonuclear fusion, it recreates the early universe conditions of high temperature and density that allows the H and He gas to continue on with their fusion, liberating free energy and increasing the entropy of the universe in the process.

Gravity clumps, first dark, then ordinary matter to form a star.

Gravity thus acts as a catalyst to allow thermodynamically favourable nuclear reactions to occur reasonable fast, without it, fusion reactions would be so rare as to be virtually non-existent, exactly like a box of hydrogen and oxygen gas: the reaction is thermodynamically favorable, but needs a spark to get it going. In this sense, gravity is the spark of life like natural proton gradients.

This answers our earlier question of why the Sun is a hot spot, in an otherwise cold sky, gravitational collapse takes a big cloud of dust and collapses it into a star with lower entropy than the gas from which it came.

The sun is a relatively low entropy source of free energy.

Of course, stars are also the source of heavier elements, like oxygen, without which we would have no water and no life as we know it.

More generally, the energy that heterotrophs like us extract from organic compounds or that chemotrophs extract from inorganic compounds, is essentially just electrons sinking deeper intro electrostatic potential wells, chemical disequilibrium.

In every redox reaction, an electron starts out at a higher potential in the electron donor, like sugar and ends up at a lower potential in the electron acceptor, like oxygen. Stars give us all the elements!

And phototrophs use the free energy in starlight to raise the electrons back up to the top of the potential wells, so the cycle can repeat.

If the star is large enough, it will explode as a supernova, creating all of the elements heavier than iron, like uranium.

We use radioactive elements like uranium as fossil fuels (fission), they also helped to keep the interior of the Earth warm and thus geologically alive, which is important for the existence of life.

Gravitational PE -> KE -> thermal energy which provided the primordial heat of the Earth, making Earth geologically alive (thermal disequilibrium)

The same gravitational clumping also makes planets ordered structures via differentiation: layers of heavier elements sinking to the bottom, and lighter elements rising to the top.

## Summary

Gravitational clumping generates gradients and structure, and is a catalyst that facilitates entropy-increasing processes essential for life, like fusion in stars.

The three sources of free energy for life:

1. Gravitational potential energy that becomes kinetic energy
2. Nuclear: fusion, tons of hydrogen and helium out there where if we could create the conditions
3. Chemical: chemistry of life, through eating food, move to lower energy forms

Tracing the free energy that heterotrophs like us need to live all the way back to the mysterious baryons non-conservation, slight imbalance in matter/antimatter, in the very early universe.

## Black holes

Black holes are a most extreme consequence of Einstein's theory of space, time and gravity.

According to Bekenstein and Hawking, SMBHs have very large entropy.

Although they represent only a tiny fraction of the total energy in the observable universe, they seem to represent the vast majority of entropy, why?

Why are black holes sucking up such a vast amount of that entropy?
