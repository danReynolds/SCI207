# Genetic Evidence for Life

Evolution works slowly by random mutation and non-random natural selection.

Starting with the DNA of the Last Universal Common Ancestor of all life today, mutations
slowly accumulate as species differentiate.

Comparing amongst the DNA of species alive today allows biologist to map evolutionary history:

* Two species with very similar DNA have more recent divergence
* Two species with very different DNA have more ancient divergence

Just as sharks branched off earlier than primates, some modern microbes are more closely related to the earliest organisms than others.

Unfortunately, the evidence about the nature of the organisms near the root of the tree is not clear:

Initially they were thought to be extremophiles (organisms living under extreme conditions), like those living today near deep-sea hydrothermal vents or deep underground

But recently evidence emerged fro non-extremophiles, like certain living archaea.

# Geological Evidence for Life

Did life originate on land? Unlikely.

All life today requires water as a solvent for chemical reactions, a cell being a bag of water.

Early atmosphere had no ozone layer to protect creatures from the Sun's intense UV.

Did life originate in Darwin's warm little pond?

Organic compounds can form spontaneously. Tides and wetting/evaporation would have increased their concentration, spurring reactions that may have led to life.

Volcanic hot springs could have offered the energy to support an origin of life.

 But again, not much protection from UV.

## Deep sea vents or underground:

* Protection from Sun's UV
* Plenty of chemical energy to fuel reactions that may have led to life, reactions between water and minerals in rock
* Even if life arose in Darwin's ponds, lunar evidence of asteroid/comet impacts of the "late heavy bombardment", ~3.9 bya, would have destroyed all life that didn't migrate tot the deep-sea or underground.

# How did Life Begin?

Life is very complex chemistry:

**Amino Acids** are the building blocks of life. More than 100 amino acids occur in bacteria and plants but only about 20 are commonly found in animals.

12 can be synthesized by the human body. The remaining 8 must come from our diet and are called essential amino acids.

Amino acids are made up of proteins, the second largest component of human muscles, cells and other tissues (water is the largest).

**Proteins** are long chains of amino acids folded up in a complicated 3D structure, both of which determine the protein's function.

Functions include:

* Catalyzing metabolic reactions (enzyme)
* DNA Replication
* Responding to stimuli (tissue repair, etc)
* Transporting molecules around

DNA replication:

More than a dozen enzymes are involved in unzipping the DNA, checking and correcting errors, and re-zipping the duplicated DNA. DNA is replicated with miniscule errors, extremely hide fidelity replication.

### Initial Puzzles

At the very least we need:

**Amino Acids**: building blocks of proteins, where do these come from
**Lots of time**: for something interesting to happen

## Early Earth

Age of the Earth and the concept of deep time:

**Theology**: A few thousand years to infinite, or cyclical, commonly 5000-10000 years.

**Starting in 1700s**: Rock erosion, sedimentation, salt in oceans, 10-100 million years

**1856: Helmholtz:** Assume the Sun's energy from gravitational collapse, determines the sun is no older than 22 million, and Earth can't be older than the sun, but this was too small because it ignored the real energy source of the sun, fusion, which is what heats the sun, not gravitational forces.

**1862: Lord Kelvin:** Cooling of initially molten Earth, 20-400 million, but this is also too small because it ignored heating due to radioactivity of the rocks.

**By later 1800s, geology and evolution** argued for much older (billions), bitter disputes. Darwin said at the time of Kelvin that the Earth must be billions of years old based on the pace of evolution that Darwin determined.

**1904 Ernest Rutherford**: realized radioactivity could heat the Earth, age could be much greater than Kelvin's estimate of 20 million.

Today we know that the Earth is 4.54 +- 0.05 BYO

Radiometric dating (Potassium-40, Argon-40) of meteorites left over from the Solar System formation: 4.567 BYO

Consistent with radiometric dating of oldest Earth rocks (zircon crystals in Australia) -> 4.404 BYO

Consistent with radiometric dating of the oldest Apollo Moon rocks

Potassium radioactivity decays, creating more argon, getting trapped inside the rock. So wait and see the rock lose potassium, gain argon, count them and determine the ratio and figure out how old it is. Measure the age of the oldest meteorites on Earth.

Over time the brightness of the Sun goes up, compare with other starts that also do this, and compare the brightness of similar mass stars to determine age.

The Sun formed from the gravitational collapse of a small part of a giant molecular cloud H + He + heavier elements, aka dust, stardust. 3/4 Hydro, 1/4 Helium, 2% heavier elements in the sun. Stars are usually formed in clusters, collapsing and getting hot enough for fusion to start, get a Sun. Have orbiting dust particles, carbon, oxygen, etc.

The Earth formed in a few million years by the eletrostatic then gravitational accretion of this dust into grains -> clumps of grains -> planetesimals ~10 km -> planetsized

Initially the Earth had **no oceans or atmosphere**:

* Made from rocky/metallic planetesimals, icy ones formed further out from the Sun.

* Too small and warm to hold onto the H or He gases and too little other gases around.

Current model suggests:

* Rocky/icy planetesimals far from the Sun later flung inward by gravitational encounters

* Trapped water and gas in this rock was later outgased by volcanoes (when Earth cooler)

* Water vapor condensed to form oceans

* Gases mainly CO2, also N2, H2S, SO2, H2 formed early atmosphere.

Zircon evidence suggests Earth possibly had continents, oceans and atmosphere as soon as 100 million years after the planet first formed.

U-Pb dating -> solid zircon 4.4 BYA
O isotopes -> solidified in presence of water
Radioactive rocks, or impact that made Moon -> accelerated heating -> outgassing

Note: Life arose in a **nearly oxygen-free** environment.

**02 is highly reactive** -> prevents complex organic molecules forming outside cells.

So life as we know it could not form in the present environment on Earth.

The kind of ice that is in comets has different isotopes in its water than in Earth, we'd need to show that the kind of water in a comet is the same as in Earth if we wanted to determine that life came from water on comets.

## Origin of Organic Molecules

Famous Miller-Urey experiment:

Assumed wrongly that early Earth atmosphere was methane and ammonia and energy driving the chemical reactions was lightning.

Readily found that the mixture synthesized amino acids, and other organic molecules.

Similar experiments today, problem: Don't know exact composition of the early atmosphere, especially H2 content.

Other sources:

Chemical reactions between water and minerals near deep-sea vents.

Materials from space: Asteroids and comets, UV from Sun acting on dust in solar nebula.

Chemistry -> Biology

Plenty of organic molecules around, but how do these form living, replicating cells?

Random chance is virtually impossible, must be a natural mechanism. Too small a chance that all the amino acids spontaneously click together in the right way to create a cell that then reproduces and we get life.

Looking for high probability chemical pathways:

## Chicken and Egg Paradox 1

Problem: Modern DNA cannot replicate without catalyzing proteins (enzymes), and enzymes cannot be made without DNA. Which came first?

Possible solutions: 1980s, RNA itself can catalyze many cellular biochemical reactions, including partially their own replication.

This supports the idea of an earlier RNA world where RNA serves as both genetic and catalysing molecule.

Take the simpler molecule RNA, and itself can act as a protein, and catalyze its own replication. We know that DNA requires a complex protein to replicate, but RNA could have replicated by itself, acting as its own protein.

So RNA life could have come first, not needing the enzymes that require DNA life.

### RNA World

**Experiment**:

* Inorganic minerals, a kind of clay, can facilitate self-assembly of RNA bases.
* Quickly and easily produces RNA strands up to a few dozen bases in length.
* Zircon grains analysis suggests clay was widespread 4.4 bya.

That clay, the rock crystal, acts like an enzyme, and the RNA bases fit in the pockets of the clay.

Experiment:

In order for RNA to act as an enzyme, it has to be long: needs > 165 bases for RNA to be able to catalyze its own replication.

Note 1: Short strands easily peel away from the clay and fold in ways that promote joining.

Note 2: Strands as small as 5 bases are able to catalyse various chemical reactions, like joining short strands into longer strands. They could then build up longer and longer bases until they could self replicate.

Given the countless clay grains, and that the RNA enzyme for joining is very simple, it is not unreasonable to expect very long RNA strand to form naturally and spontaneously.

Once you have one RNA strand, it self-replicates exponentially.

After only a few hundred self-replications, they could fill the entire volume of Earth's oceans.

## Chicken and Egg Paradox 2

Problem: Which came first: the cell membrane, or its contents: genes (RNA/DNA) and proteins

Possible Solution: Scientists have know for decades that cooling a warm-water solution of amino acids can cause them to bond to form a spherical shell **pre-cell**. **Lipids** fats in water also form pre-cell on the surface of the **same clay material** that help assemble RNA molecules. Some precell membranes exhibit real cell membrane behavior like:

* Selective molecule transport across the membrane
* Electrostatic energy storage and discharge
* Growth and splitting into daughter spheres

So spherical pre-cells form around the clay minerals that assemble the RNA, getting the RNA in the semi-permeable pre-cell membranes.

Confining RNA and other organic molecules in pre-cells would facilitate the origin of life:

Keeping molecules concentrated increases reaction rates and likelihood of creating a self-replicating RNA.

Suppose a self-replicating RNA emerges that codes for a replicating enzyme. The pre-cell would keep this enzyme inside where it would help this particular RNA and no others to self replicate faster -> dominate.

Experiments suggest relatively high early RNA mutation rates -> many opportunities for natural selection of more efficient self-replication pathways and increased complexity.

## RNA World -> RNA World

Gradually these RNA organisms would have become alive or biological in the sense we think of now.

Biological natural selection could then take over, resulting eventually in a DNA world:

* Similarity between RNA and DNA
* DNA is a more durable hereditary material
* DNA is less prone to copying errors

Summary of RNA world:

1. Normally forming organic molecules are the building blocks of life
2. Clay minerals catalyze production of RNA and membranes that form precells.
3. Molecular natural selection favors efficient, self-replicating RNA molecules
4. True living cells with RNA genome give rise to RNA world
5. DNA evolves from RNA and biological evolution
