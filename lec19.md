# Models of Gravity

Why does a rod with two weights on each end bend?

Scientists attempted to find physical explanations for a gravitational force.

## Nicolas Fatio de Duillier (1960)

Space is filled with randomly moving particles or waves, pushing on bodies from all directions. Nearby bodies shield/shadow another, resulting in net forces that look like attraction.

## Descartes (1644)

Believed empty space cannot exist, so must be filled with aether, which moves in circular motions around bodies. These vortices exert forces on each other, and other bodies and that's gravity.

Later, there were more serious problems, the force model was discovered to not work:

Experiment: Force model predicts wrong orbits

Theory: Force model violates speed of light limit

By the early 1900s many scientists, including Einstein, recognized that the force model of gravity was in serious trouble and we were looking for a new, better model.

But where to even begin the search?

Einstein considered an acceleration model:

1. Force Model

Wrong.

2. Acceleration Model

Also explains the bending rod, but without having to invent a mysterious invisible force!

There is no force pulling down, the ground is accelerating up.

Wouldn't this proposal require the Earth to be expanding faster and faster?

The Big Question: How can the ground be accelerating up without moving up?

Recall: In special relativity, Einstein had unified space and time into spacetime. We must think about what is happening not just in space, but in space and time together.

Newton would say when a person steps off a ladder, the rocks of the Earth are pulling her down, causing an acceleration, causing her path to curve.

Einstein comes along though and says that the force model of gravity says that we need the acceleration model. Gravity is not a force pulling down on stuff, but it is causing the ground to accelerate up.

When Alice steps off the ladder, there is no force acting on her, rather the Earth is accelerating up towards her. But then the path should be straight.

## How might this be possible?

In special relativity, Einstein showed that artificial gravity in a rotating space station is associated with warping of space and warping of time. The same is true for artificial gravity in our accelerated room.

Clue: Maybe real gravity is not a force, but a warping of spacetime.

Maybe we can achieve accelerating up without moving up and not accelerating down but still falling down by drawing our diagram not on a flat surface, flat spacetime, but a curved spacetime.

Draw the diagram on a curved surface. Space and time are curved!

When Alice steps off the ladder, there are no forces acting on her. The rocks of the Earth do not pull her down, she should move in a straight line from the top of one ladder to the bottom of the other ladder, since there is no acceleration.

## Curved Spacetime Solves the Problem

The curved spacetime model already explains everyday observations: weight, free-fall, etc.

Key question: Does the model predict anything new, that we might not have guessed to try to observe?

## Testing the Curved Spacetime Model of Gravity

There are many high precision tests that the curved spacetime model of gravity passed, and the force model fails. Newton's force model of gravity is scientifically obsolete, like alchemy, the Bohr model of the atom, spontaneous generation, etc.

Einstein's proposed 3 tests of general relativity, *classical tests*:

3. Gravitational redshift

There are many modern tests:

* Many weak field tests: within the solar system, lunar and planetary laser/radar ranging; Shapiro time delay, Cassini mission to Saturn, frame dragging, etc.
* Many strong field tests: binary pulasars spiralling into eachother predicted by Einstein's model, Advanced LIGO direction detection of gravitational waves and binary black holes announced in 2016, it's all Einstein gravity now!

The direct detection of gravitational waves is particularly spectacular.

When a gravitational wave passes by, masses freely floating in a ring shape experience *no force*.

Science changes our perspective, our understanding of the ultimate nature of reality, sometimes dramatically.

General relativity turned upside down our understanding of our everyday experience of gravity on Earth.

The mass of the Earth does not pull down on objects.

The mass of the Earth curves spacetime so the ground and everything standing on it is literally accelerating without moving up, we experience this acceleration via weight, free-fall.

What feels right is irrelevant, Experiment is the judge.

## Black Holes

Black holes come from a star collapsing.

Star in equilibrium between outward thermal pressure and inward gravitational pull.

Equator of black hole, singularity appears, horizon stops expanding, event horizon appears, collapse begins, equator of star.
