# Galactic Redshift

Most natural explanation is expanding space (Einstein's theory, which also explains many other things)

The further a galaxy is away from us, the further it is apparently receding away from us.

Expanding space means that, as we run time backwards, the same amount of matter occupied smaller and smaller volumes of space.

The further back in time we go, the more dense and compressed the matter would have been, and when gas is compressed, it heats up. So it would have been hotter.

Prediction: *The universe must have started in a very dense, hot state (everywhere in space)*.

Do we have evidence for this?

## Cosmic Microwave Background

Yes, due to **Cosmic Microwave Background**.

As we look farther out into space, the further back in time we see.

Question: Can we look far enough out into space to see back in time to the fiery beginning?

This **glow** is coming from all directions in the sky, with almost perfectly uniform intensity, with extremely tiny fluctuations of about 1 part in 100,000.

This light was emitted **long ago** and **far away** and has been traveling towards us ever since. It has covered a cosmic distance in a cosmic time.

What does this light that we are bathed in (bath of thermal radiation) tell us? That when the universe was 380000 years old, 0.003 its present age:

It is the most perfect source of pure thermal *blackbody radiation* ever observed.

The agreement between theory and observation is so exact that error bars are not visible on the graph.

We had a hot, dense beginning.

Why does this make sense?

Why does this makes sense?

* The electrons and protons were initially too hot to form neutral H atoms (their thermal energy was greater than the ionization energy of H). Light (photons) could not travel very far before being scattered by free electrons. The plasma was opaque, like a fog.

* Suddenly, and for the first time, light could move freely through space: the matter and radiation had decoupled. The matter in the universe became transparent. All of space was filled with freely moving radiations, photons at a temperature of about 3000K

* The green photons, that last scattered off an electron long ago and far away, then traveled for 13.8 billion years through transparent space to reach Earth now.

* The black photons went off in other directions, never reaching Earth. The photons that were near the Earth's location 13.8 billion years ago have long since traveled elsewhere. Space is still uniformly filled with these photons everywhere, moving in all directions.

From Earth's perspective, we see photons arriving from every direction in the sky, originating long ago from a giant spherical surface that is almost at the edge of our observable universe, called the **surface of last scattering**.

But remember, space continued to expand over those 13.8 billion years while these photons were in flight, cooling them.

Redshift: observable/emit ~ 1100

observable = corresponds to the cold photons at about 2.73K
emit = corresponds to hot photons at about 3000K

Space has expanded by a factor of 1100 since the light from the surface of last scattering was emitted, a mere 380000 years after the Big Bang.

At present, the whole universe is bathed in thermal microwaves, hence: Cosmic Microwave Background.

The expansion of space redshifted early photons to microwaves, forming the cosmic microwave background we observe today.

Observation of the CMB in 1964 ruled out Fred Hoyle's competing **Steady State** model of the universe (eternal expansion of space with continuous creation of matter), and gave strong support for the finite age, hot Big Bang model.

**1948**: Physicists Ralph Alpher and Robert Herman first predict the CMB (later, independently predicted by Robert Dicke and others)

**1964** Radio astronomers Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson accidentally measure the CMB. They detected a faint, steady, mysterious noise coming form all directions on the sky, originating outside our galaxy.

At the same time, Dicke and colleagues were building an antenna to measure CMB.

**1978**: Penzias and Wilson get the Nobel Prize in Physics.

## Abundance of the Light Elements

* By about 1 second after the Big Bang, the universe contains protons and neutrons but they are **too hot** to fuse into heavier nuclei.
* Between about 3 minutes and 20 minutes the universe is cool enough for fusion, get deuterium, helium-3, helium-4, lithium
* After 20 minutes temperature and density are too low to sustain fusion, no heavier elements.

From basic particle physics, we know that the proton to neutron ratio must have been 7:1 during nucleosynthesis.

Notice that virtually all of the neutrons end up in helium-4, there are neutrons in deuterium, helium-3, and lithium, but there are only trace amounts of these nuclei.

Thus for every He, which has two neutrons, there should be 14 protons. Two protons in Helium leave 12 protons in H.

The mass of 12 H is about the mass of 3 He. So by mass, there should be three times as much hydrogen as helium, which is **Exactly** what is observed: 75% H, 25% He

Using particle physics again, we can predict the abundance of other light elements, relative to hydrogen.

Key point: Predicted abundances depend very sensitively on the **density of baryons**, protons and neutrons, during nucleosynthesis.

Agreement between predicted and observed abundances, grey bar, tells us the amount of ordinary matter in the universe: atoms can make up about 4% of total mass-energy, total includes dark matter and dark energy.

This is one of the strongest pieces of evidence that the majority of dark matter is nonbaryonic, non ordinary atoms.

## Summary of Evidence for the Big Bang

* Darkness of the night sky
* Galaxy redshift
* Cosmic microwave background
* Abundances of light elements

Such detailed agreement between theory and observation leaves virtually no doubt that 13.8 billion years ago the universe was in a hot, dense state which then expanded and cooled.

The mystery of origins has been pushed back to the blink of an eye after the Big Bang.

The physics of the early universe is an extremely active area of research.

The growing connections between macroscopic and microscopic physics is particularly exciting.

The CMB is not perfectly uniform over the sky. It has tiny fluctuations ~1:100,000 which indicate that the temperature and density of matter in the early universe varied slightly from place to place: hotter and less dense in some places, colder and more dense in others.

Rough argument: At 380,000 years after the Big Bang, light would have had a chance to travel only about 380,000 light years in any direction, or a sphere of about 2x380000 = 760,000 light years in diameter. Thus the largest blobs of matter that could have the same temperature, different parts of the gas in thermal equilibrium, hot or cold, would be about this size.

For things to come into thermal equilibrium, they would had to reach eachother, so one point could only equalize with another point 760,000 light years in diameter.

The current radius of the surface of last scattering is about 46 billion light years.

But space was about 1100 times smaller at the time of the last scattering, so the circumference of the red circle at that time was about 2pi x 46 billion light years / 1100 = 260 million light years.

So the angular size of the blob should be about 1 degree.

But wait: In making this calculation, we assumed that space on a cosmic scale is flat. Einstein's theory says that it could be flat, positively curved, or negatively curved.

This curve could act like a lens, distorting our view of the blobs from cosmic background.

Positive or negative curvature of space would distort the angular size of these blobs, like a cosmic-sized gravitational lens. Positive curvature would magnify, negative would shrink.

We know that it cannot be positive or negative curvature because we see the blobs that we would expect from a flat space, therefore space is flat.

**So what?** Einstein's theory says that a flat universe requires a certain **critical density of total mass-energy**. Less open, more closed. We seem to be at critical density.

This critical density is presently equivalent to about 5 hydrogen atoms per cubic meter of space.

The problem:

* Ordinary matter (stars, gas and dust) ~ 0.2 H per cubic meter
* Dark matter (non-baryonic) ~ 1.1 H per cubic meter
* Total matter (ordinary + dark) ~ 1.3 H per cubic meter

Thus to make space flat, we're missing ~ 5 - 1.3 = 3.7 atoms per cubic meter of space. Where is it?

That missing mass-energy is called **Dark Energy**.
