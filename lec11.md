Life on Earth is intimately connected with the cosmos:

Thermonuclear fusion in stars created the heavier elements up to iron like O, C, N.

 **Stellar Supernovae** created the elements heavier than iron, radioactive elements that heat the Earth's interior and help keep it geologically alive (necessary for life).

 A significant fraction of the **organic molecules** on Earth were formed in **dusty interstellar clouds** and eventually rained down on the Earth during the Late Heavy Bombardment.

 Perhaps most crucially, the universe has provided ample sources of **free energy**.

 The Sun:

 * Low entropy energy from the Sun is re-radiated into space as **high entropy** energy.
 * The Earth is exporting much more entropy than it receives: This is the entropy generated by the maintenance of all the low entropy, ordered, structures on the Earth like hurricanes, the water cycle, solar temperature gradients, and life itself.

 The Earth:

 * Chemical and thermal disequilibrium

 Big questions that we ask about ourselves:

 * Who are we? What is the nature of life?
 * Where do we come from? How did life evolve?
 * Why are we here?

 These questions are intimately connected with big questions we ask about the universe as a whole:

 * What is the nature of the universe? Size, composition, structure, role of gravity.
 * How did the universe evolve (Expansion, cooling gravitational clumping)
 * What is its **origin**, Why something vs nothing? (Big Bang, inflation, other origin ideas)

In particular, we will address the crucial free energy question we asked earlier:

Why is the Sun a hot spot in an otherwise cold sky?

* Hot spot part: What is the origin of the Sun?

* Cold sky part: Equivalently, why is it dark at night? We will see that the darkness of the night sky is intimately connected to the fact that our universe is not infinitely cold but of finite age,  it had beginning this sis also deeply mysterious.

Thus: The fact that life exists at all is intimately intertwined with two fo the greatest mysteries of the universe itself: Its origin, in such a low entropy state.

# The Size of the Universe

Earth is 0.1 light seconds in size. It takes like a tenth of a second to pass through Earth.

Distance from the Earth to the Moon is about 60x the radius of Earth. It takes about 8 minutes for light to get from the Sun to the Earth.

The scale of the Milky Way Galaxy is on the order of a 100,000 light years in size. Takes that long from one side to the other.

Virgo supercluster: 100s of millions of light years.

local galactic groups, galaxy to galaxy: Billion of light years between

100 billion light years: Observable universe

Because light moves at a finite speed, the farther out in space we look, the further back in time we see.

Since the universe had a beginning, Big Bang, we can't look further back in time than this, and therefore further out in space than this.

The edge of the **observable universe** is called our cosmological horizon, much like a horizon on Earth: there is certainly stuff beyond it. Just can't see it!

## Isaac Newton

* Imagined Earth's gravity reaches to the Moon and figured out how the strength of gravity would need to diminish with distance to explain the Moon's orbit: As inverse distance squared.
* He then extended the idea to imagine the Sun has gravity (with inverse square force law), which reaches throughout the solar system and controls the motions of the planets.
* He showed how this correctly explained virtually all aspects of the hitherto mysterious Solar System (Kepler's Law of planetary motion, Earth's tides, precession of the equinoxes, etc) - a real *tour de force*. The Principa is justly regarded as one of the most important works in the history of science.

* By showing that the planets orbit for the same reason an apple falls, Newton quite literally unified the Earth and the Heavens.
* He demolished the age-old separation between us and the cosmos, opening up a whole universe of mysteries for science to explore.

## Role of Gravity

LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory) 4km length

Strain = 10^-21 => 1/1000 times size of proton.

Inspiral signal "chirp", lasted about 7ms.

Repeated in two independent detectors?

Merger of two black holes about 1 billion light years away.

3 solar masses worth of energy converted to gravitational wave energy.

Opens entirely new window on the universe: "Hear" instead of just "see"

**Gravity**: Is the dominant force on large scales (planets, galaxies, cosmos)

**Strong** and **weak** nuclear interactions are short range forces. They act only between particles separated by nuclear distances, e.g., inside the nucleus of atoms?

**Electromagneticism** is relatively strong, long-range force, but it tends to cancel out over long distances because there is an equal amount of positively and negatively charged particles in the universe: Strong electrostatic attraction tends to bring these together and neutralize them. (e.g. atoms are normally electrically neutral)

Gravity is a relatively weak, long-range force, but it tends to add up on large scales because all particles have positive mass (no negative mass particles to cancel the effect of the positive mass particles), e.g. the Earth has a gravitational field, but virtually no net electro static field.

## Gravity Dominates

Even though gravity is the most familiar force we experience, it is the most mysterious.

It is not a force like the others (strong, weak, and electromagnetic). As Einstein
