It would be impossible for life on earth to exist without carbon. Carbon is the main component of sugars, proteins, fats, DNA, muscle tissue, pretty much everything in your body. The reason carbon is so special is down to the electron configuration of the individual atoms. Electrons exist in concentric 'shells' around the central nucleus and carbon has four electrons in its outermost shell. As the most stable thing for an atom to have is eight electrons, this means that each carbon can form four bonds with surrounding atoms.

What's special about carbon, and the reason that silicon-based lifeforms are restricted to science fiction (and lead-based lifeforms are hardly ever mentioned) is that it can form double-bonds which share more than one electron with another atom, as shown below:

The double bond consists of two different types of bond. Each bond is made up of two electron orbitals (one from each atom) which have overlapped.

So why can carbon and not silicon manage this double-bond trick? The answer lies in the size. Carbon is the smallest of all the atoms with four outermost electrons, which means that the electrons in the above-and-below orbitals are close enough to overlap and form that second bond.

For silicon however, there are more electron orbitals in the way, the entire atom is bigger, and it is almost impossible for the outer orbitals to get close enough to form a double bond.

You can just about get silicon-silicon double bonds if you try hard, but they are fairly unstable and will take any chance they can to loose that double-bond in favour of forming another single one

Researchers reported in San Diego, California, this week at the semiannual meeting of the American Chemical Society that they have evolved a bacterial enzyme that efficiently incorporates silicon into simple hydrocarbons—a first for life. Down the road, organisms able to incorporate silicon into their cells could lead to a novel biochemistry for life, although for now creating actual silicon-based creatures (like the Horta from Star Trek, pictured) remains a long way off.

To get biology to adopt silicon, Frances Arnold, a chemist at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena, along with postdoctoral assistant Jennifer Kan and graduate student Rusty Lewis, started by isolating a so-called thermophilic bacterium, which grows in hot springs. Like many organisms, the bacterium contains an enzyme called cytochrome c, which shuttles electrons to other proteins, making it widely useful in biochemistry. In some cases, however, enzymes in thermophilic bacteria expand their roles to carry out other reactions on the side. So the Caltech researchers tested their microbe and found that in rare cases its cytochrome c also added silicon to hydrocarbons.

cytochrome c’s silicon-adding ability is so feeble that it’s probably just a byproduct of the enzyme’s function—not even close to its primary role

And on the basis of what we now know about the various chemical elements, carbon would seem to be the atom best suited to form the long-chain molecules needed for life. But are we being chauvinistic? How do we know that other biochemistries aren’t possible?

silicon also has 4 unpaired electrons in its outermost orbital. Alas, as noted above silicon cannot bond to other atoms as well as carbon can. That's because, as shown in Figure 8.22(a), a carbon atom's 4 unpaired electrons normally reside in its second orbital —and since 8 is the maximum number of electrons allowed in the second orbital of any atom, this orbital becomes full and complete when carbon binds with other atoms on all 4 sides. Accordingly, a carbon chemical bond is among the strongest of all. By contrast, silicon's 4 unpaired electrons normally reside in its third orbital, as shown in Figure 8.22(b)—and here the maximum number of electrons permitted in the third orbital of any atom is 18. Although silicon might normally have atoms bonded to each of its 4 sides, just like carbon, the silicon bond isn’t as strong as the carbon bond because the outer orbital of silicon often lacks a full complement of electrons, even when it's bonded to other atoms. Generally, carbon bonds are twice as strong as silicon bonds.

Of even greater importance, carbon links most strongly to other carbon atoms. This is especially true for diamond, which is made of carbon atoms bonded to one another, as sketched in Figure 8.23. In fact, diamond is the hardest substance known; hardness results from great bond strength. Furthermore, carbon bonds are also unaffected by water, giving carbon another advantage in the most likely liquid medium for life. Silicon, on the other hand, doesn’t bond as well to other silicon atoms, and not well at all in the presence of many liquids. Chains of silicon are especially unstable in water; they break apart.

When C chemically reacts with O, the result is CO2. This is a gas and thus can easily combine with other compounds; in our case, humans exhale CO2 after inhaled O has reacted with the C in our bodies during respiration. When silicon (Si) reacts with O, however, the result is quartz (SiO2), which is a solid unlikely to interact easily with other compounds. Can you imagine living creatures exhaling quartz bricks each time they take a breath? Thus we shouldn’t be surprised that silicon plays no biochemical role on Earth, despite its widespread abundance on our planet.

We don’t see a complex stable chemistry [solely] of silicon and hydrogen, as we see with carbon and hydrogen.  We use hydrocarbon chains in our lipids (molecules that make up membranes), but the analogous silane chains would not be stable.

But when carbon oxidizes--or unites with oxygen say, during burning--it becomes the gas carbon dioxide; silicon oxidizes to the solid silicon dioxide, called silica. The fact that silicon oxidizes to a solid is one basic reason as to why it cannot support life.

In a carbon-based world, the basic storage element is a carbohydrate having the formula Cx(HOH)y. This carbohydrate oxidizes to water and carbon dioxide, which are then exchanged with the air; the carbons are connected by single bonds into a chain, a process called catenation. A carbon-based life-form "burns" this fuel in controlled steps using speed regulators called enzymes.

“As soon as you have oxygen with it or water…you have a rock and nothing is happening anymore,” Schulze-Makuch says.
And, while water is vital for life on Earth, silicon-based life would not be able to use it the same way. Its biochemistry would have to rely on another molecule (perhaps methane) for many of its functions.
“Silicon is all around but it’s tied up in rocks…with these very strong silicon-oxygen bonds that living systems would have to break in order to use silicon,” Arnold says. “And then once they did use silicon, maybe those compounds aren’t even stable under Earth conditions.”

The surface temperature of Titan, Saturn’s largest moon, is a frigid -290 degrees Fahrenheit. The moon has little oxygen – any water is frozen – but liquid methane flows in strange rivers and lakes. The silicon-based compounds (called silanes) that could potentially build alien cells should be stable under those conditions.

The silicon that does exist on Titan is buried deep near the moon’s core. “In order to have more silicon-based life, you would have to have it on the surface [and] available,” Schulze-Makuch says. “But you could imagine certain planets or moons or scenarios where this may be the case.”

Another possibility would be silicon-dependent aliens that don't simply replace carbon with silicon. These aliens would instead use molecules that combine the two. Materials with carbon-silicon bonds have already been found in space, "but they are very rare, there are so [many] more carbon compounds,” Schulze-Makuch says. “Life would probably still have a tough time.”

While no life form has been known to naturally forge carbon-silicon bonds, we find ways of making these compounds all the time. Molecules that bind carbon and silicon show up in many products, from pharmaceuticals to electronics. These have to be made in the lab, but Arnold hopes that using microbes to make these compounds would be cheaper and more environmentally friendly, wouldn’t use up precious metals, and could happen at room temperature.
