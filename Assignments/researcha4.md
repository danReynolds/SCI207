Then came 1998 and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of very distant
 supernovae that showed that, a long time ago, the universe was actually expanding
  more slowly than it is today. So the expansion of the universe has not been
  slowing due to gravity, as everyone thought, it has been accelerating.
  No one expected this, no one knew how to explain it. But something was causing it.

 Maybe there was some strange kind of energy-fluid that filled space.
 Maybe there is something wrong with Einstein's theory of gravity
 and a new theory could include some kind of field that creates this
  cosmic acceleration. Theorists still don't know what the correct explanation
  is, but they have given the solution a name. It is called dark energy.


One explanation for dark energy is that it is a property of space.
Albert Einstein was the first person to realize that empty space is not nothing.
 Space has amazing properties, many of which are just beginning to be 
 understood. The first property that Einstein discovered is that it is
 possible for more space to come into existence. Then one version of
 Einstein's gravity theory, the version that contains a cosmological constant,
 makes a second prediction: "empty space" can possess its own energy.
 Because this energy is a property of space itself, it would not be diluted
 as space expands. As more space comes into existence, more of this
 energy-of-space would appear. As a result, this form of energy would cause
 the universe to expand faster and faster. Unfortunately, no one understands
  why the cosmological constant should even be there, much less why it would
  have exactly the right value to cause the observed acceleration of the universe.

Another explanation for how space acquires energy comes from the quantum
theory of matter. In this theory, "empty space" is actually full of
temporary ("virtual") particles that continually form and then disappear.
But when physicists tried to calculate how much energy this would give empty
space, the answer came out wrong - wrong by a lot. The number came out 10120
times too big. That's a 1 with 120 zeros after it. It's hard to get an answer
 that bad. So the mystery continues.

 Another explanation for dark energy is that it is a new kind of dynamical
 energy fluid or field, something that fills all of space but something
 whose effect on the expansion of the universe is the opposite of that of
 matter and normal energy. Some theorists have named this "quintessence,"
 after the fifth element of the Greek philosophers. But, if quintessence is
 the answer, we still don't know what it is like, what it interacts with, or
 why it exists. So the mystery continues.

 leading contender for explaining dark energyâ€”is quantum vacuum energy.

 The idea is tied to quantum mechanics, which predicts that even in the vacuum of space, particles are constantly winking in and out of existence, generating energy.

To help solve the riddle, NASA and the U.S. Department of Energy had planned to conduct the Joint Dark Energy Mission (JDEM), the first program specifically designed to study dark energy.
