Aging is the result of accumulating damage to molecules such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids (DNA, RNA)

If enough molecules are damaged, cells function less well, tissues and organs will deteriorate and eventually our health declines.

if an oxygen molecule only takes up one or two electrons, the result is one of a group of highly unstable molecules called reactive oxygen species that can damage many kinds of biological molecules by stealing their electrons. These renegade oxygen-containing species can mutate your genes, damage the lipids that make up your cellular membranes, and break the proteins that do much of the cell's work, thereby causing cellular injury in multiple and overlapping ways.

Fruit flies genetically engineered to produce high levels of enzymes that destroy reactive oxygen species lived almost 50 percent longer than normal flies. The same enzymes also made the microscopic roundworm C. elegans live significantly longer than normal.

Many scientists speculate that another contributor to the aging process is the accumulation of cellular retirees. After cells divide about 50 times, they quit the hard work of dividing and enter a phase in which they no longer behave as they did in their youth.

It turns out that each cell has 92 internal clocks—one at each end of its 46 chromosomes. Before a cell divides, it copies its chromosomes so that each daughter cell will get a complete set. But because of how the copying is done, the very ends of our long, slender chromosomes don't get copied. It's as if a photocopier cut off the first and last lines of each page.

As a result, our chromosomes shorten with each cell division. Fortunately, the regions at the ends of our chromosomes—called telomeres—spell out the genetic equivalent of gibberish, so no harm comes from leaving parts of them behind.

But once a cell's telomeres shrink to a critical minimum size, the cell takes notice and stops dividing.

In 1985, scientists discovered telomerase. This enzyme extends telomeres, rebuilding them to their former lengths. In most of our cells, the enzyme is turned off before we're born and stays inactive throughout our lives. But theoretically, if turned back on, telomerase could pull cellular retirees back into the workforce. Using genetic engineering, scientists reactivated the enzyme in human cells grown in the laboratory. As hoped, the cells multiplied with abandon, continuing well beyond the time when their telomerase-lacking counterparts had stopped.

Could reactivating telomerase in our cells extend the human lifespan? Unfortunately, the exact opposite—an untimely death from cancer—could occur. Cancer cells resurrect telomerase, and by maintaining the ends of the cell's chromosomes, the enzyme enables the runaway cell division that typifies cancer. It may, therefore, be a good thing that shrinking telomeres mark most of our cells for eventual retirement.

According to most scientists, aging is caused by the interplay of many factors, such as reactive oxygen species, DNA mutations, and cellular retirement. Unfortunately, as a result, there is probably no such thing as a simple anti-aging remedy.

In the wild, predation and accidents guarantee that there are always more younger individuals reproducing than older ones. Genes and mutations that have harmful effects that appear only after reproduction is over do not affect reproductive success and therefore can be passed on to future generations. In 1952, Peter Medawar proposed that the inability of natural selection to influence late-life traits could mean that genes with detrimental late-life effects could continue to be passed from generation to generation. This theory is called the mutation accumulation theory.

Inside the nucleus of a cell, our genes are arranged along twisted, double-stranded molecules of DNA called chromosomes. At the ends of the chromosomes are stretches of DNA called telomeres, which protect our genetic data, make it possible for cells to divide, and hold some secrets to how we age and get cancer.


Telomeres are repeated sequences on the ends of DNA strands, they help protect the DNA strand from getting shorter during cell division. Since during cell division, the primer does not bond to the very end of the strand, a section of the DNA at the end is not included in the copying. But since it is repeated by telomeres, it does not shorten the amount of info, it removed excess.

Cells normally can divide only about 50-70 times with telomeres getting progressively shorter until the cells become useless or die.

Telomeres allow cells to divide without losing genes.

Before a cell can divide, it makes copies of its chromosomes so that both new cells will have identical genetic material. To be copied, a chromosome's two DNA strands must unwind and separate. An enzyme (DNA polymerase) then reads the existing strands to build two new strands. It begins the process with the help of short pieces of RNA. When each new matching strand is complete, it is a bit shorter than the original strand because of the room needed at the end for this small piece of RNA. It is like someone who paints himself into a corner and cannot paint the corner.

Telomerase adds bases to the ends of telomeres. Run out of telomerase and telomeres grow shorter and the cells age.

Shorter telomers are associated with shorter lives.

## Factors in Aging:

* Telomere Shortening
* Chronological Age
* Oxidative Stress
* Glycation

### Oxidative Stress

A major cause of aging is "oxidative stress." It is the damage to DNA, proteins, and lipids (fats) caused by oxidants, which are highly reactive substances containing oxygen.

### Glycation

Another factor in aging is "glycation." It happens when glucose, the main sugar we use as energy, binds to some of our DNA, proteins, and lipids, leaving them unable to do their jobs. The problem becomes worse as we get older, causing body tissues to malfunction, resulting in disease and death. Glycation may explain why studies in laboratory animals indicate that restricting calorie intake extends lifespan.

Scientists speculate that metformin interferes with a normal aging process, called glycation, in which glucose combines with proteins and other important molecules, gumming up their normal workings. The metformin finding is particularly striking because people who have diabetes, even if it is well controlled, typically have somewhat shorter life spans than their healthy counterparts.
