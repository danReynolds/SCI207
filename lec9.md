# Right Conditions

**Free Energy**: Needed to fuel metabolism and allow low entropy structures to form.

**Light Energy**: For photosynthesis from a nearby star, some deep-sea bacteria seem to get energy from the infrared and visible light emitted by molten volcanic rock.
**Chemical Energy**:  For chemosynthesis (deep-sea hydrothermal vents), bacteria or archaea that oxidize inorganic compounds of iron, sulfur or hydrogen...may support life below the surface of mars, Jupiter's moon Europa, and other planets.
**Thermal Energy**: Heat from gravitational tidal flexing

**Europa**, one of Jupiter's moons, may have a 100km thick outer layer of salty H20 underneath due to heat from **gravitational tidal flexing** with a tectonically active frozen upper crust. Could Europa support life?

Need:

* Source of molecules from which to build organisms
* Source of free energy to fuel metabolism
* Liquid medium - most likely water - for transporting the molecules of life

**Liquid water** is probably the most stringent condition and any world that satisfies it likely satisfies the other two. Hence NASA's follow the water strategy.

Might be too limiting but must start somewhere.

What about:

## Moon/Mercury

Small, core has cooled, no volcanism of tectonics, no fresh source of atmosphere outgassing gravity so weak that any past atmosphere has escaped into space. Super hot in the Sun. Super cold in the shade.

* Have some water ice at bottoms of polar craters, and the Moon has water molecules mixed in the soil, but no **liquid water**.

Life? Highly unlikely.

## Venus

* Atmosphere: 96% CO2, pressure 90x that on Earth's surface, equivalent to pressure 1km under Earth's oceans. Completely enshrouded in thick, sulfuric acid clouds.
* Surface: Temperature 470C, planet-wide, day and night (hot enough to melt lead), some continents, planet wide volcanic/tectonic resurfacing 1 BYA, still active volcanoes?

Venus has a runaway greenhouse effect: Venus started like Earth, its sister planet, with similar volcanic outgassing of CO2 and H20 into the atmosphere, but...

1. Earth: a bit further from Sun, cooler.

H20 gas cools, condenses, falls as rain, makes oceans, and evaporates again. H20 liquid/gas cycle.

CO2 dissolves in rain, stored in, stored in oceans, carbonate rocks, tectonic subduction, volcanoes, photosynthesis.

Left with almost no CO2, a little O2, H20.

2. Venus: a bit closer to Sun, warmer

Even if it started with oceans, warmer means more evaporation, air can hold more H20, more H20 greenhouse gas, making it even warmer and get a positive feedback loop.

Oceans evaporate, H20 photo-dissociates, oxygen becomes chemically bound up in rock.

Left with lots of CO2 and no H20. Runaway greenhouse effect!

Venus may have had an ocean, and maybe even life up to 4 BYA, but volcanic/tectonic resurfacing up to 1 BYA would have erased all fossil evidence.

Microbes may still survive in the upper atmosphere. Cooler 50km up, liquid water droplets, sulfuric acid could provide chemical energy for extremophiles.

## Mars

Went in opposite direction as Venus.

* Evidently started warm and wet, with a fairly thick atmosphere, > 2-3 BYA. Volcanic outgassing estimates suggest early atmosphere denser than Earth's today, and enough water to fill planet-wide oceans 10s to 100s of meters deep.

* But it is now cold and dry, with atmospheric pressure so low < 1% Earth and 95% CO2, that **liquid water cannot exist on the surface**.

Why? Basic physics: Maris is half the diameter of Earth, one-quarter the surface area, but only one-eighth the volume. Twice the surface to volume ratio.


Lost its internal heat energy quickly. Lost further volcanic outgassing and lost protective magnetic field. Coupled with weaker gravity, solar wind then likely stripped away the atmosphere and some of the water vapour.

Also, Mars has/had no ozone layer, so UV rays can split H20 into hydrogen gas that escapes into space and oxygen gas (that reacts with the surface -> rust)

Greenhouse effect that must have been important in having a warm and wet early period, at least intermittently, diminished and Mars froze over. Surface temperature is now -143C, to 35C, average -63C.

Evidence of past life on Mars:

Kasei Valley outflow channel -> Catastrophic flooding around 3 BYA, comparable to largest ever floods on Earth (scablands). Some outflow channels on Mars are as recent as 10s MYA.

Valles Marineris is long and deep crack on Mars, widened by erosion? Flow channels?

Curiosity rover found that Gale Crater contained an ancient (3.3-3.8 BYA) freshwater lake that could have been a hospitable environment for life.

Summary of past water:

* Sensing technology: Orbital imaging and remote sensing, spectroscopic, radar, etc, and surface landers and rovers.
* Evidence for: Enormous outflow channels, ancient river valley networks, deltas, and lake beds; and the detection of surface rocks and minerals that could only have formed in liquid water. Possibly a large ocean that covered one third of the planet.

Present Water:

* Known: Almost entirely in the form of ice in the shallow subsurface, and in the polar ice caps. South cap is permanently covered by about 8m of CO2 ice. North cap is covered by 1m of CO2 ice in the Norther winter only. If the known water ice were melted, it would be enough for a 35 meter deep planet wide ocean.

* Even more ice is likely locked away in the deep subsurface. Pockets of liquid water may exist underground, where it is warmer and higher pressure.

* 2015: Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter confirmed summer flows of liquid salt water flowing down crater slopes, then evaporating. Curiosity finds nightly films of liquid salt water in subsurface.

Past:

Curiosity soil analysis reveals that ancient Mars had the right chemistry to support living microbes: S, N, O, C, Phosphorous, recall ADP, ATP and clay minerals.

Curiosity also revealed evidence for organic molecules, C, H, when heated the perchlorates alter the organic compound structure, making identification uncertain.

Mars almost certainly had the right conditions.

Present:

The most likely place to find present life is below the ground, safe from intense UV and cosmic rays and warm enough for possible liquid water.

Curiosity seems to have found fluctuating concentrations of methane in the atmosphere. Also found earlier, debated for 50 years. If present, could be biological or geological in origin. Either way, Mars may be more alive than we think.

Future plans:

More rovers, drilling down, return samples. The technology is amazing, but not easy.

## Gas Giants

Very thick hydrogen or hydrogen/helium/methane atmospheres.

### Jupiter and Saturn

H gas -> liquid -> metallic (extreme pressure and temperature) -> rocky/icy core

### Uranus and Neptune

H, he, methane gas -> water and hydrocarbon ices -> rocky/ice core.

Life? Not likely.

No solid surface, if you fell in to Jupiter, you would continue sinking downward until the liquid H reached the density of water (press ~ 2 million atmospheres, temp around 5000K)

Jupiter/Saturn: About 100km below the cloud tops, the right conditions, water temp, energy, lightning can exist, but there are strong vertical convection currents that would sweep organisms to higher/lower regions that are too cold or hot.

Uranus/Neptune: Similar story, but maybe life could exist in the high pressure liquid water/methane/ammonia ocean near the core? Problem, energy source?

## Moons of Jupiter (Europa)

Energy source: Gravitational tidal flexing -> heating

Cracked, icy surface, craggy, 250m high peaks and smooth plates jumbled together.

Average surface temperature at equator = -160C -> water is hard as granite. But, relative smoothness and youth, plus magnetic field -> salt water ocean beneath.

Different models being debated, but note that a 100km thick ocean would be twice the volume of Earth's oceans.

Volcanic vents in the ocean floor, like on Earth, could provide enough energy for a **small amount of simple life**.

2015: NASA laboratory experiments suggest that the yellowish-brown streaks near younger surface areas are likely sea salt from a subsurface ocean, discolored by exposure to particle radiation due to Jupiter's magnetic field, suggests the ocean surface is **interacting** with its rocky seafloor, important for the moon's ability to support life.

Possible model of Titan's internal structure that incorporates data from NASA's Cassini spacecraft.

The mantle, in this image, is made of icy layers, one that is a layer of high-pressure ice closer to the core and an outer ice shell on top of the sub-surface ocean.

## Titan

Atmosphere: Thick, chemically active, rich in organic compounds, chemical precursors to life?

2013 NASA simulations of Titan's atmosphere suggest complex organic compounds could arise. Two months later, NASA detected polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the upper atmosphere.

### Life on Titan?

Has water-based ice instead of rocks.

Surface: Bodies of liquid ethane and methane, solvent for a different kind of life. Instead of glucose + oxygen -> carbon dioxide, maybe acetylene + hydrogen -> methane.

Evidently suggesting this has been detected, but non-life explanations are more likely, and have yet to be ruled out. Note: Extremely cold temperature -> any life would have very slow metabolism.

Future missions? Land in a lake?

## Life on Exoplanets

**Basic idea**: Measure the light, visible and IR coming from an exoplanet.

**Brightness**: Overall brightness gives crude information about ratio of water to land, daily cloud cover, seasonal snow and ice.

**Spectrum**: Even a crude spectrum reveals the average surface temperature, a better spectrum can reveal chemical fingerprints of gases in the atmosphere (CO2, O2, O3, CH4, H20, etc), types of minerals or ices on the surface, etc. Precise abundances and ratios can provide strong evidence of the presence or not of life on the planet.

Volatile gases like oxygen and methane must be continually replenished, suggesting life (but not necessarily conclusively) could have non-biological origins.
