# Introduction

In this third and final section of the course, *Everything*, we will explore the idea of a theory of everything and begin to address the question: *What is the ultimate nature of reality?*

We will start with the major revolution in our understanding of reality that took place in the early 1900s, now called *modern physics*, which will include special relativity, general relativity, and quantum mechanics. The central them in all cases is **Unification**.


## Einstein's Two Relativity Theories

A central figure in this revolution was Albert Einstein. He played a key role in birth of quantum mechanics, and developed two theories of relativity:

1. **Special Relativity (SR):**

* 1905
* Unified space and time -> 4D flat spacetime
* Includes: Time dilation, length contraction, relativity of simultaneity, universal speed limit (speed of light), etc.

2. **General Relativity (GR):**

* 1915
* Unified spacetime and gravity -> 4D curved spacetime (which says gravity is not a force, but rather a curvature of spacetime)
* Includes: Bending of light, gravitational waves, black holes, cosmology, etc.

**Principle of Relativity**: There is no way to tell, from inside a closed room, if the room is moving (assuming motion with constant velocity and no rotation)

Ex. Train moving along tracks, assuming no vibrations or acceleration, you wouldn't know you're moving.

There is **no experiment** you can do inside a closed room to detect its motion. This principle of relativity was first suggested by Galileo in 1632, is it true for all experiments, including ones involving light?

Early 1800s: Wave nature of light suggested the answer is no. Einstein showed how it could be YES if the nature of space and time was different than we had been assuming.

## Nature of Light

* 1690: Huygens published a theory that light is a wave. But waves require a medium, something that is waving. Huygens imagined that light consists of waves in some kind of light medium called ether, that uniformly fills all of space.
* 1704: Newton published a theory after Huygen's death, in which he imagined that light is a shower of particles that move through the vacuum of empty space.
* Huygens' wave-in-ether and Newton's particle-in-vaciuum models of light were debated for a century.
* In the early 1800s, Thomas Young did simple experiments, wave interference, that showed definitively the wave nature of light. Throughout the 1800s, virtually all physicists accepted this.

Key fact about waves in a medium: Ex. sound wave-in-air, but same for light wave-in-ether

**Clap hands once**: The disturbance of air creates an expanding spherical wave front, sound wave. Once the wave front is created, it takes on a life of its own, propagating by one air molecule bumping into its neighbour, like dominoes, with a fixed speed relative to the still air.

**Keep Clapping**: You create a sequence of nested, expanding spherical wave fronts, each moving with speed c relative to the air.

**Move while Clapping**: Each time you clap, the spherical wave front you create expands outwards from the point at which you created it, regardless of the motion of your hands.

Doppler effect, YES.

Assume light is a wave-in-ether, as experiments suggested, with Alice at rest in the ether.

Suppose her experiment with light takes 3 seconds.

She knows it takes 3 seconds for light to go to the top of her ship and back down.

She goes to sleep and, in the middle of the night, Bob gives her spaceship a push so it is drifting through the ether. She wakes up and repeats the experiment, not knowing she is drifting.

Bob says it takes longer, say 5 seconds. Why? For bob, at rest in the ether, the speed of light is independent of the motion of the source, Alice, the speed is still c, but the distance is longer.

Bob saw the light move in an arch, because Alice was moving, but Alice saw it just go up and down. So to Bob, light had to travel further this time, and take longer.

Assumed Answer: 5 seconds. Universal time, when 5 seconds elapses for Bob, 5 seconds elapsed for Alice.

Einstein's Answer: 3 seconds. **Universal Relativity**. Relativity extended to include light. There is no experiment Alice can use inside her closed spaceship, inclluding light, to detect its motion.

Problem: This violates Universal Time. The great grandfather clock in the sky assumption must be abandoned. Time elapsing at one rate for one person cannot be applied to everyone in the universe.

## Time Dilation

Looking at the triangle of light Bob sees, the up/down speed of the light pulse is slower than c.

For Alice to see this speed as c, universal relativity, she can't tell she is moving, her clock must be running slower, relative to Bob's by the same factor.

If she sees it in the same amount of time, but its velocity is less relative to Bob, than Alice's time must be slowing down relative to Bob, so that it takes the same amount of time.

## Testing Time Dilation

For everyday speeds, the time dilation is negligible. Time dilation becomes noticeable only when the velocity of the reference frame approaches the speed of light.

Solution: Use an unstable elementary particle that is traveling near the speed of light.

Unstable means that it well decay into another particle in a fixed average time. Example: A certain type of particle, a kaon, at rest in the lab, will spontaneously decay into two other particles, pions, in an average time of about 9x10^-11 seconds.

In particle accelerators, this type of kaon is easily created, traveling at nearly the speed of light. Using our assumed ideas about space and time, it would be able to travel, on average only about 2.7cm before decaying.

However, it is observed to travel much further in the observer frame of reference. How? In Einstein's spacetime, time is moving much slower for the Kaon, Alice, relative to time in the lab, Bob, so when 9x10^-11 seconds elapses for the kaon, much more time (10x) elapses in the lab, allowing it to travel further, 27cm.

From the Kaon's point of view, the lab is shrunk, the lab is length contracted relative to the Kaon, so it sees the lab compressed in the direction of motion by 10x. This way, relative to it, it still only moves 2.3cm because the distance has been shrunk.

Logic implies that, along with time dilation, there must also be **length contraction**.

Extreme example: Ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECR)

Space is filled with cosmic rays, extremely high energy (fast moving) particles, like protons, with energies millions of times that achievable at the LHC.

When they slam into the atomic nuclei in the Earth's upper atmosphere, they create a cascading air shower of secondary particles that can be detected and analysed.

The origin of UHECR is still mysterious, jets in Active Galactic Nuclei? Supernova explosions?

Example: For a proton to have an energy equal to the GZK limit, maximum energy for long distance travel through CMB, it would have to be moving at nearly speed lof light. At this speed, the TD and LC factor is 2x10^-11

Suppose it came from the Andromeda Galaxy, which is 2.5 million light years away.

From our perspective, it would take the proton 2.5 million years to cover the distance of 2.5 million light years.

From the proton's perspective, ti would take only 2x10^-11 x 2.5 million years =  30 minutes to cover a length-contracted distance of 2x10^-11  2.5 million light years = 3 AU, less than the size of the Solar system.

Some cosmic rays are truly intergalactic travelers!

So you would observe it taking only 30 minutes and crossing the solar system, not the galaxy from the point of view of the object moving that fast.

All objects along the proton's path, including the Milky Way galaxy would be length contracted in the direction of motion.

## Summary

Experiments show that light behaves like a wave -> wave-in-ether model of light.

In assumed space and time, a wave-in-ether model of light would violate the principle of relativity.

Einstein corrected our understanding of time by demanding the principle of relativity be true even for experiments involving a wave-in-ether model of light -> time dilation.

But time dilation logically requires length contraction. LC and TD are two sides of the same coin. You can't have one without the other. Together they imply that space and time are unified in a 4D spacetime with a certain geometry.

But first: LC and TD also work together to enforce a universal speed limit.

## Universal Speed Limit

Suppose Alice is at rest in a spaceship moving with speed v relative to Bob.

She then starts running forwards at 1m/s in her spaceship:

She covers 1m every second according to her ruler and her clock.

But Bob sees Alice's 1m length contract to 1/y m.

And for Bob, Alice's 1s is time dilated to ys.

Thus, from Bob's perspective, it takes Alice longer than 1s to cover a distance of less than 1m.

Bob sees Alice's additional speed to be only 1/y^2 m/s, less than 1m/s

As v approaches c,y approaches infinity, Alice's additional speed approaches zero.

LC and TD enforce a universal speed limit, makes sense!

In Einstein's spacetime, Alice can throw a ball at 99% c relative to herself, then get in a rocket, accelerate and catch up with the ball, then throw the ball again at 99% c, relative to herself. She can repeat this process indefinitely.

Yet the speed of the ball will always be less than c from Bob's perspective, who stays at rest in Alice's original reference frame.

There is a speed limit, enforced by LC and TD, but no acceleration limit. Alice can accelreate in a orcket with say, constant acceleration = g, forever. From Bob's perspective, she will just get closer and closer to the speed of light, but never reach it.

## E = MC^2

Due to time dilation, Bob's force acts for a shorter time in Alice's frame, and so does not cause as much acceleration as he expected. Although the mass does not change, it has a greater effective inertia from Bob's perspective due to TD.

In particle accelerators like the LHC, each time a particle comes around the loop it is given a kick, acceleration, which boots its energy by a certain amount.

Although its speedy hardly increases, just a little closer to speed of light each time around, its energy and momentum can be increased indefinitely, its energy is E = ymc^s, Einstein's E=mc^2 which increases without limit as v -> c (y -> infinity)

## Lesson: Time is a geometrical distance

Geometrical distance in spacetime, which depends on the path followed, Alice's elapsed time is the geometrical length of her path through Bob's spacetime. A chronometer, your watch, is a spacetime odometer.

Ex.

Twins paradox:

Bob stays on Earth and Alice travels to a planet 4 light years away at 80% the speed of light and then returns to Earth.

According to bob, it takes her 5 years to get there and 5 years to get back, he has aged 10 years.

According to Alice, it takes her only 3 years to get there and there years to get back, she has aged only 6 years.

Why the difference? It's not surprising that if Alice and Bob drove from X to Y along two different paths, their odometer readings would be different.

We used to think that only 3D space had a geometry, Euclidean, and time was unrelated to space.

Based on Einstein's ideas, his math prof Minkowski unified space and time into spacetime, the three dimensions of space plus the one dimension of time became a four-dimensional spacetime.

Ex.2 Ladder Paradox

Ladder at rest is no longer than garage, won't fit.

Ladder moving, form the point of view of the garage, the moving ladder is length contracted. Although the ladder maintains the same length in its own space, it is shorter in the garage's reference point. If it moves fast enough, it will momentarily fit in the garage.

But from the point of view of the ladder, it is the garage that is length contracted. By the principle of relativity, the garage and the ladder are equally allowed to consider themselves to be at rest, so things like LC and TD must be reciprocal. The won't fit situation appears to be even worse!

This is exactly what the Minkowski geometry of spacetime says from the point of view of the ladder:

The back door momentarily closes and opens first, while a length of the ladder is protruding from the front of the garage.

Later, the front door momentarily closes and opens, while a length of the ladder is protruding from the back of the garage.

What is simultaneous for one person is not simultaneous to all other reference frames.

**Now** is a relative concept.
