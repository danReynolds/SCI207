# Why is there Life?

Roughly speaking, England took Crook's microscopic formula and figured out its consequences for macroscopic things, and discovered a generealization of the Second law, that applies even for systems driven far from equilibrium by energy flows:

Probability(forward) / Probability(backward) = $e^{S}$

It says that the more irreversible a spontaneous process is, the more it increases the entropy of the universe.

Or, the most probably outcomes are the ones that on the way to getting there **increase the entropy of the universe the most.**

Analysing the new equation givees a key new insight:

* Other things being equal, the better a driven system can absorb and dissipate energy from that driving force, sunlight, food, the better it is able to do highly irreversible things like cell division.

England has applied the idea to predict the amount of dissipation that should occur self-replication of RNA molecules and E.coli bacteria.

England:

> A great way of dissipating more is to make more copies of yourself. Thus the empirical, bioliogical fact that reproductive fitness is intimately linked to

Speculation: Dissipation-Driven Adaptation of Matter

* A deeper analysis of the new equation suggests that clumps of atoms surrounded by a bath at some temperature, like the atmosphere of the ocean, should tend over time to arrange themselves to **resonate better** and better with the sources of mechanical, electromagnetic or chemical work in their environments.

Analogy: The length of the ropes of a swing will spontaneously adjusts so the natural frequency of the swing matches the driving frequency allowing the swing to absorb and dissipate most energy.

Why is this plausible?

1. Alone, thermal jostling of the atoms is not enough to change their configuration, as atomic bonds are hard to change
2. But a periodic driving force like pushing a swing, can help the thermal jostling make configuration changes happen.
3. After a change, if the additional energy absorbed, say from sunlight, from the driving force is dissipated as heat back into the environment it is not available to help the system go back, like a ratchet. **So irreversibility is connected to dissipation, entropy increase.**
4. While configuration changes are mostly random, the most irreversible or durable changes are those that happen when the system at that moment happens to be **better** at absorption and dissipating energy from the driving force.
5. As time passes, these less erasable changes accumulate, like a ratchet, shifting the system preferentially in the direction better absorption and dissipation.
6. After a long time it looks like the system has self-organized into a state that is **well adapted** to its environment.

England tested it:

England has run computer simulations of a random clump of toy atoms, driven at some random frequency.

Result: We do indeed see emergent adaptive resonance of the system, supporting the hypothesis that organized kinetically stable structures emerge and persist because their formation is reliably accompanied by extra work absorption and dissipation.

There may be many examples of well-adapted structures that did not have parents. Non-Darwinian adaptation.

England: *You start with a random clump of atoms, and if you shine light on it for long enough, it should not be so surprising that you get a plant*.

Amazing!

Ex. The **chlorin ring** is a simple ring of molecules with Mg++ at the center, of exactly the right size and shape, length of swing, to resonate with photons of two different frequencies, red and blue. These are absorbed and dissipated but green photons are not, which is why leaves are green.

Ultimately, the energy absorbed from the photons is used to generate a proton gradient across the chloroplast membrane, an ATP synthase is used to tap the gradient and charge ADP molecules to ATP, which then carry the energy to all the cells.

This energy is used to make sugar and oxygen, and power other cell functions:

6CO2 + 6H20  reacts via light -> C6H12O6 + 6CO2

Could the chlorin ring by an example of an ordered structure that spontaneously evolved have happened?

Recent experiments have shown that in the presence of light of a given frequency, silver nanorods will spontaneously self-assemble into a ring like structure that resonates at that frequency to best absorb and dissipate the energy in the light.

Could the ATP synthase be another more complex example of an ordered structure that spontaneously evolved by dissipation-driven adaptation of matter, to allow proto-cells to harness and dissipate more energy from the natural proton gradient near deep-sea hydrothermal vents?

> There may be many examples of well-adapted structures that did not have parents

Application to Evolution and the Origin of Life:

Darwinian evolution explains how life evolved after it began, but not how it began.

If correct, **dissipation drive adaptation of matter** might explain both. England:

> From the perspective of the physics, you might call Darwinian evolution a special case of a more general phenomenon

Key new idea is **adaptation without replication**. Dissipation-drive adaptation could have spontaneously evolved structures that got better and better at eating energy in the environment, like the clorin ring that eats sunlight.

Such structures would then be available in the *pre-biotic soup* as building blocks for yet more complex structures and eventually replicating life. It didn't have to happen **suddenly**.

**Replication itself** may be understood under the **same** umbrella of dissipation-drive adaptation. Recall England:

> A great way of dissipating more is to make more copies of yourself

England:

> Under the right circumstances, which aren't rate at all, matter tends naturally toward greater organization, complex structures and adaptive behavior, making life more likely.

Dissipation driven adaptation of matter may underlie many physical phenomena, ranging from snowflakes and sand dunes, to self-replicating vortices in the protoplanetary disc.

The point is: The transition from non-living matter to living matter may not be a big leap.

**Vortices** in a shear flow spontaneously replicate by absorbing energy from the surrounding fluid. This has applications to dead zones in protoplanetary disks, and may play a role in star and planet formation.

## Summary

**Dissipation drive adaptation of matter** suggests that a random system of particles in a heat bath, driven out of equilibrium by an external energy source, may spontaneously create ordered structures
that allow it to better absorb and dissipate that energy.

Why? The heat bath jostles the particles around, allowing them to explore many configurations. the external energy source biases configuration changes, ratcheting toward structures that better resonate with the energy source, better at eating the energy.

While still speculative, there is reason to hope that it may be a fundamental principle behind a wide range of phenomena in nature, including possibly the origin and evolution of life. It's a promising idea.

## The Importance of Thermodynamics

Origin and evolution of life?

It's a big question, and all of the sciences play an important role.

Obviously, biology leads the way, but chemistry is becoming crucial as the questioning moves to smaller scales, molecular biology.

Physics is the most fundamental of the three sciences, dealing with energy.

Comments on thermodynamics:

* Living organisms are many-particle systems immersed in a heat bath, driven out of equilibrium by the matter and energy they exchange with their environment. This is precisely the subject of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, The recent improvements in our physical and mathematical understanding of this branch of physics seems bound to impact our understanding of life.

Einstein:

> A theory is the more impressive the greater the simplicity of its premises, the more different kinds of things it relates and the more extended is its area of applicability.

The application of thermodynamics has, in the past, led to profound shifts in our understanding of the world.

The application of thermodynamics to understand the colour spectrum of hot objects sparked the discovery of the quantum nature of the universe.

The application of thermodynamics to black hole entropy sparked the first concrete step towards a unified theory of quantum gravity.

it wouldn't be surprising if the application of thermodynamics to the phenomenon of life provides important new insights.

## Epilogue: Life and Thermodynamics

Life is consuming free energy, $F = U - TS$. Energy will never run out. It is eternal. It is free energy that the universe is running out of, as total entropy inexorably increases. Roughly speaking, total U does not change, but total S will continue to increase until F = 0, then no life.

Where does this free energy come from?

The Earth absorbs high energy photons from the Sun, warming its surface.

On average, the Earth does not get hotter, notwithstanding global warming, etc.

Thus the Earth must radiate exactly the same amount of energy back into space, but now in the form of lower energy (cooler) photons (infrared)

Small number of hot photons in -> large number of cool photons out, but same energy on both sides. Same amount of energy spread around many cooler photons compared to earlier same amount in few hot.

Since energy in = energy out, there must be **many cooler photons** radiated back into cold space for each **hot photon from the Sun**.

More photons = more ways of dispersing the same energy.

The Earth is exporting much more entropy than it receives, this is the entropy generated by maintenance of all the low entropy ordered structures on Earth.

Like hurricanes, water cycle, temperature gradients due to the Sun, etc.

What's crucial in all this is that the **Sun is a hot pot in an otherwise cold sky**.

If the entire sky were as hot as the sun, then its energy would be of no use to life on Earth, so why is the Sun a hot spot in an otherwise cold sky/

The obvious answer is **thermonuclear fusion**. But the question we're really asking is:

How is it that the Sun is a source of low-entropy energy?

Equivalently, where does the Sun's free energy come from?

In the next part of the course we will trace the source of the Sun's free energy back through ever lower and lower entropy states of the universe.

## Why is it an otherwise cold sky?

This is equivalent to the question, why is it dark at night?

The obvious answer is that the sun isn't shining.

But it is more subtle than that, in the next part of the course we will see that the darkness of the night sky is intimately connected tot he fact that our universe is not infinitely old, but of finite age, it had a beginning. This beginning is also deeply mysterious.

The fact that life exists at all, the origin of life, is thus intimately intertwined with two of the greatest mysteries of all time: The origin of the universe itself, in such a low entropy state.

But before that, we'll take a look at the question of extraterrestrial life:

The origin of life on Earth is still deeply mysterious.

However, the answer seems to be within the reach of science, at least generally.

Right conditions, chemical, solar free energy, organic molecules, liquid water, increasingly plausible origin models => at least simple life is probable.

The question *are we alone?* is increasingly interesting to scientists.

Why? The discovery of life of any kind beyond the Earth would deeply and forever change our perspective of who we are, and what our place in the universe is.

This is what science does:

* Discovery of heliocentrism
* Discovery of deep time and deep space
* Discovery of evolution and genetics
* Discovery of the Big Bang
* Discovery of the quantum nature of the universe, free will, etc.

Why now? Scientists have always been interested in the question, *are we alone*, but in the last few decades, this interest has dramatically intensified:

We now know that there are planets out there. Without them, ET life is unlikely.

We now have much better reasons to think that *biology might be universal*.

We now have sufficient technology to begin looking for ET life.

The study of life in the universe is one of the most rapidly growing fields of active scientific research.

With his discovery of a universal law of motion, f=ma, and **gravitation**, Newton unified the heavens and the Earth. However he thought the order in our Solar System was initially imposed by God.

Gravity explains the motions of the planets, but it cannot explain who set the planets in motion. God governs all things and knows all that is or can be done. The unknown was pushed onto God.

In his 1755 book, General History of Nature and Theory of the Heavens, the philosopher Immanuel Kant introduced his **nebular hypothesis**, attempting to explain the **origin of the order** in the Solar System.

Since then, the nebular hypothesis has been significantly developed, and provides a simple, natural explanation for the formation of stars and planets, not just the Solar System but throughout the universe.

A. Large relatively dense interstellar cloud of gas and dust, with small random overall rotation begins gravitational collapse.
B. Gravitational energy -> thermal energy -> sparks fusion in protostar. Rotation speeds up and cloud flattens into protoplanetary disc.
C. Electrostatic then gravitational clumping in the disk -> planetestimals -> planets. We now have sophisticated computer models.
D. Rocky planets form in warm region near star, like Earth, icy and gaseous planets form in cold region far from the star, like Jupiter.

So scientists expected virtually all starts to have planets, but before 1988, the number of **known exoplanets** was zero.

Since 1988, the number of known exoplanets has risen to more than 2000. Extrapolating the numbers, our galaxy contains over 10 billion Earth-like planets orbiting Sun-like starts in the habitable zone.
