# Diffusion

There is no reason why a system can't go back to the original state. It is merely stupendously unlikely.

Process is irreversible just by the law of large numbers.

Makes sense.

No **physical law** governs this process. It is driven one way and not the other by purely random, purposeless thermal motion. Of all the possible next states, the vast majority are spread out, so chances are the next state will be more spread out.

We are eating order. Extracting order from the food we eat, not energy.

## Diffusion of Thermal Energy

It's the same for a cup of coffee. There are simply stupendously more ways for thermal energy to be spread uniformly through the coffee and the room then to just stay in the coffee.

There is nothing preventing the thermal energy flowing from the warmed air back into the room temperature coffee, its just very unlikely.

This lawless, purposeless tendency for particles or energy to spread out is called the **Second Law of Thermodynamics**. We get more **entropy**.

## Second Law of Thermodynamics

The entropy of an isolated system never decreases.

This is perhaps the most potent statement in all of science, rivaled only by the first law of thermodynamics: The conservation of energy.

Roughly speaking, **entropy** is a measure of **disorder**. The natural diffusion or dispersion of energy increases the disorder in the universe.

Disorder can decrease locally, but at the expense of greater increase in disorder elsewhere, so the universe as a whole is moving towards greater entropy/disorder.

While energy is conserved, it is continually being degraded into a lower quality, more spread out form = Heat death of the universe.

While this might sound bleak, it is precisely this lawless, purposeless process that is responsible for virtually all change in the world and it is the very engine of life itself.

It's not energy, but degradation of energy that makes the world go round.

**Entropy** was first understood in the context of the flow of thermal energy from a hot object to a cold object.

Entropy of cold object increases at a greater rate than decrease of hot object, leads to net increase.

The hot object lost -Q/Thot and the cold object gained Q/Tcold, so Q/Tcold - Q/Thot > 0 since Tcold < Thot, meaning that we get a net increase of entropy when the change occurs.

Entropy was alter understood much more deeply at the microscopic level by the great Ludwig Boltzmann and summarized in the equation:

$$S = k\log{W}$$

This formula is used to quantity the amount of entropy, S.

k is called Boltzmann constant, and has units of energy per degree of temperature.

This tells us that entropy is connected to temperature and energy.

W is the number of microstates compatible within a given macrostate.

This is one of the deepest insights we have into the nature of everyday reality.

Before we explore it in more details, let's appreciate its profound generality:

* Deals with spreading of thermal energy
* But also changes in order, or complexity

ex. A balloon is full of air.

Macroscopic description: Volume, pressure, temperature
Microscopic description: Position and velocity of every air molecule

W is the stupendously large number of different possible **microscopic states** that would be indistinguishable from a **macroscopic** point of view.

ex.2 Diffusion of dye molecules

**Macroscopic** description: Less spread out, more spread out

**Microscopic** description: Position and velocity of every dye molecule

As the blob of dye molecules spreads out, the number of distinct microscopic states that look the same macroscopically, which is called W, increases exponentially.

**Disorder** is a vague word. Entropy is a measure of how many different ways a set of particles can be arranged in position and velocity and still look the same.

DNA is a highly ordered arrangement of atoms. Almost any rearrangement will make DNA look different, so it has a low W and low entropy.

A rock crystal is less ordered in the sense that it is a repeating pattern of a smaller set of ordered atoms which are interchangeable. Larger W, higher entropy, than DNA.

## Consider a Simple model universe

Atkins - the 2nd Law

let:
Universe = 40 x 40 = 1600 atoms.
System = 10 x 10 = 100 atoms.
Environment = 1600 - 100 = 1500 atoms.

Atoms have either one unit of energy or no energy.

Universe starts with 100 units of energy.

Thermal motion of ON atoms jostle neighbouring atoms, transferring their energy, dispersing and diffusing it.

But energy is conserved, total number of ON atoms is 100.

Initially, there is only one way all the energy can be in the system and none int he environment, which is W = 1.

Therefore, S = log W = log 10^0 = 0

One unit of energy diffuses from the system in the environment.

Temperature is a measure of the average thermal energy per atom.

Thus:

The temperature of the system decreases, and that of the environment increases, like the cooling cup of coffee warming air in the room.

The universe has taken the first step towards thermodynamic equilibrium, system and environment at same temperature.

The number of different ways that one ON can be distributed in the environment is 1500.

The number of different ways 99 ONs can be distributed is 100.

So the number of different ON combinations combined with off combinations, with only 1 ON outside of the system in the environment is 100 * 1500 = 10^5.2

Entropy of the universe increases from 0 to log10^5.2 = 5.2

Try it for 2 ONs in the environment:

get 1500x1499/2, combinations not permutations.

Then in the 100 ON molecules it can have 2 OFF in 100x99/2.

Then we get 10^9.7 combinations, so the entropy of the whole universe is 9.7.

The flow of energy from hot to cold continues to increase the entropy of the universe rapidly.

This lawless diffusion of energy continues until thermal equilibrium is reached, the system and the environment are uniform temperature.

Same average thermal temperature per atom.

The coffee and the room are now at the same temperature.

In this example, the equilibrium corresponds to 6 or 7 ON atoms, and 93 or 94 ONs in the environment.

The average number of Ons is the same in both region. 6-7/100 = 93-94/1500

Thermal equilibrium is the point of **maximum entropy**.

If more energy diffuses into the environment, it leaves fewer Ons in the system, having two effects:

While it increases the entropy of the environment, it decreases the entropy of the system more, such that the total entropy of the universe actual decreases.

Since if you go from say 98 to 99 things in the environment, get 1500 choose 99 things in environment, and 100 choose 1 in the system. Which is smaller than 1500 choose 98 and 100 choose 2.

This is a **dynamic equilibrium**, thermal energy continues to flow randomly between the system and the environment, but not in any trend.

There are just relatively few ways where the system is mostly ON and environment mostly OFF, the number of possible ways the system could bounce around arranging like that is just a very low likelihood, so it just generally doesn't happen.

The past essentially gets locked out, so the universe expands. Look up **arrow of time**: We can't go back to the past because we have spread out further. The universe is getting higher entropy, so it won't shrink, statistically unlikely.

All change is driven by the purposeless, lawless spreading of energy and particles.

## Life and the 2nd Law

Entropy can go down locally.

Living organisms exhibit a very high degree of order or complexity relative to the surrounding matter.

How do they maintain this order against the tendency towards universal decay into disorder? Doesn't life violate the 2nd Law?

What about evolution? To organisms of ever higher order or complexity? Surely it violates the 2nd Law?

While complex organisms decrease entropy, the environment is still gaining entropy, localized areas can decrease as long as there is a net increase.

ex. A freezer can convert water to ice.

Ice is a more ordered structure than water, so changing water to ice reduces the entropy of H20.

The water to ice transition releases energy, because H20 bonds in ice are more stable, stronger/lower energy than H20 bonds.

The freezer removes this energy and dumps it into the environment. The resulting entropy increase exceeds the water to ice entropy decrease, causing a net entropy increase.

A freezer does NOT violate the 2nd Law.

Can all the kinetic energy of the atoms in a motionless ball come together to spontaneously move the ball?

Car engine:

piston goes up and down as a result of combustion, some explosions causing pressure changes moving it up and down, and then a crankshaft converts it into rotational motion.


Hot gas atoms bombard the piston, which absorbs only right-moving Kinetic Energy KE. Disordered KE is converted into ordered KE. AS the atoms turn OFF, fresh disordered KE spontaneously flows in from the hot rouse, maintaining the temperature of the gas as the piston moves to the right.

As the piston moves right, air column expands, and spontaneous flow of energy from hot source into this expanded cylinder, since likelihood of it filling larger volume, greater chance of that.

Ordered KE in the form of the motion of the piston was extracted to do useful work W to make the car move.

We have made the hot, stationary ball we talked about jump up. It extracted ordered energy, KE moving the piston right, from the disordered energy radiating from the heat source.

How do humans go against the tide of increasing disorder to create ordered structures?

We build ordered machines, we create more humans, extracting order from chaos.
