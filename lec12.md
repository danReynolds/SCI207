# Composition and Structure

We have galaxies, which look distorted, why? Because gravity bends light (Thanks Einstein!)

Objects with mass have gravity, which warps space. The mass of foreground galaxies warps the light we see coming from background galaxies.

**Mass-energy** warps space and time, actually spacetime.

Time slows down closer to massive objects. Massive objects have extra space in their vicinity.

Gravitational redshift, light moving from one intensity of gravity to another may slow down or speed up. Blue light, at a higher frequency, slows down due to higher gravity, becoming red light, which has a longer wavelength. This is called **Redshift**.

## Gravitational Redshift

Einstein’s theory of general relativity predicts that the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation will lengthen as it climbs out of a gravitational well. Photons must expend energy to escape, but at the same time must always travel at the speed of light, so this energy must be lost through a change of frequency rather than a change in speed. If the energy of the photon decreases, the frequency also decreases. This corresponds to an increase in the wavelength of the photon, or a shift to the red end of the electromagnetic spectrum – hence the name: gravitational redshift. This effect was confirmed in laboratory experiments conducted in the 1960s.

When a massive object warps the space around it, if you have some volume of space, and fly around in your spaceship, you can expect by the surface area for their to be a certain volume. But if you put a massive star in there, it warps space and time, giving you more volume than if it was empty.

Mass-energy **warps** space and time, actually spacetime.

The **local** speed of light is always c.

During 1 second, the part of a light wave-front farther from a mass can move a certain distance at speed c.

But because of **time warping**, when 1 second elapses farther out, less than 1 second elapses closer in.

Thus, the part of the light wave-front closer in also locally moving at speed c, but for less time, can move a lesser distance, causing the wave-fronts to tilt and the light ray to *bend* as it travels.

The wavefronts near the bottom are closer together than at the top, and we get bending of light.

Also get **space warping**:

During 1 second, the part of a light-wave front farther from a mass can move a certain distance at speed c.

But because of space warping, that distance appears smaller in this picture when it is closer in.

This also causes the wave fronts to tilt, and the light ray to bend as it travels. One meter is shorter in the bottom wave fronts than the top. So you can fit more than you'd expect in the volume, were you to be looking from the outside, because a meter is smaller in there than out there.

For light, the two effects (time warp and space warp) contribute equal amounts to bending.

* Bend is not the right word, locally, light always moves in a straight line at speed c and it is the spacetime that is bent.
* When moving from one region of flat spacetime to another, through a region of warped spacetime, a light ray will emerge moving in a different direction relative to its original direction.
* This distorts the view of objects seen through the warped region - called a gravitational lens. But in popular science, we just say gravity bends light.
* Any form of mass-energy can create a gravitational lens: planets, stars, black holes, galaxies, clusters of galaxies, gas between galaxies, etc as well as any **invisible** forms of mass. Gravity is universal: it measures all mass, visible or not.

All these gravitational lenses distort the images of further away objects.

By measuring the distortions in detail, physicists can construct a detailed 3D map.

Surprise:

All the mass that can be seen or reasonably inferred is not nearly enough to cause the amount of gravitational lensing that is observed.

Any typical picture like this contains:

15% ordinary matter (stars, gas, dust, atoms)
85% **dark matter**

## Dark Matter

Dark matter is called **dark** because it emits no light of its own. Nor does dark matter appear to reflect or absorb light. Thus it is transparent.

The existence and properties of dark matter are inferred from its gravitational effects on things we can see.

Dark matter has not been detected directly.

The evidence for dark matter is *strong*. Independent convergent lines of evidence include:

1. Gravitational Lensing
2. Galaxy Rotation Curves
3. Anomalies in Galaxy Clusters
4. Large scale structure formation
  * Computer simulation of evolution of universe showing gravitational clumping of dark matter. Clumped dark matter attracts ordinary matter, facilitating gravitational collapse into stars -> stars gravitationally collapse into galaxies -> galaxies gravitationally collapse into clusters of galaxies (large scale structures of the universe). Without dark matter, it is hard to understand how the large scale structures we see could have evolved
  * Dark matter has gravity, attracts normal matter so that they group and become stars, etc. The simulations show that you need **~85% dark matter** in order for normal matter to clump together. If they run the simulation with just normal matter, it doesn't form stars!
5. Cosmic Microwave Background
  * The afterglow effect of the Big Bang contains evidence about the amount of dark matter there should be in the universe (20 sigma detection).

There are at least 5 independent reasons for 85% dark matter.

Mass measured in 3 independent ways:

* Orbital velocities of individual galaxies
* X-rays emitted by hot gas between galaxies (assuming pressure/gravity balance)
* Gravitational lensing of background galaxies

## What is Dark Matter?

### Baryonic Dark Matter

* **Baryons** are mainly protons and neutrons making up ordinary matter (atoms)
* Big Bang nucleosynthesis limits the amount of ordinary matter
* Of this ordinary matter, only about 20% is luminous, 80% is dark
* Examples of **dark ordinary matter**: black holes, other dark and dense remnants of dead stars, brown dwarfs, planets, warm or cold gas (most of it)
* But in total, the amount of dark ordinary matter is far short of what is needed. Most of the dark matter must be **nonbaryonic** (not protons or neutrons)

## Nonbaryonic dark matter

Two possibilities:

1. **Hot** (fast moving)

Ex. Neutrinos.

* Second most abundant particle in the universe after the photon
* More than a billion neutrinos for every proton created by the Big Bang
* Interact only through gravity and weak nuclear force, hard to detect
* Problem: mv << me: total mass of neutrinos < 1% total dark matter mass

**Bigger Problem**: Hot dark matter particles don't gravitationally clump well, in a way that could explain the large scale structure we observe.

2. **Cold** (slow moving)

* **WIMPs**: Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (like neutrino, but heavier)
* **Axions**: Hypothetical particle invented

Current consensus view is that dark matter is primarily composed of a mysterious new type of subatomic particle that is slow-moving and cold.

## Other Ideas

* Alternative theories of gravity: dark matter reveals itself gravitationally, maybe we just have gravity wrong and there is no dark matter.
* Matter in extra dimensions: that interacts only gravitationally with matter in our universe (maybe there is another universe where they see us as the dark matter).
* Primordial defects in the topology of quantum fields, which contain energy and therefore gravitate
* Etc: Very active area of physics.

Searching for dark matter particles:

1. Direct Detection:

* Detect naturally-occurring dark matter particles in labs deep underground, to reduce background cosmic rays
* Generally

## Summary

The observable universe is big: about 46 billion light-years in radius. It almost certainly extends beyond our cosmological horizon.

15% of the matter in the universe is ordinary matter, baryonic matter in the form of stars, gas, dust, etc. There are several hundred billion galaxies in the observable universe

85% of the matter in it is invisible nonbaryonic dark matter, inferred to exist by its gravitational effect on stuff we can see. No one knows what it is, but best guess is a new type of subatomic particle that is slow-moving (cold). It is one of the greatest mysteries of our times, with a worldwide race to unravel it.

This matter has structure on all scales:

Peoples, planets, solar systems, galaxies, galaxy clusters, and galaxy superclusters (and voids)

Dark matter forms the backbone of this structure, onto which ordinary matter gravitationally collapsed.

Averaged over very large distances, this matter, ordinary and dark, fills all of space almost perfectly uniformly.

If we take any big chunk of the observable universe, and figure out how much stuff is in there, it is the same as taking the same volume somewhere else. Space is almost perfectly uniformly filled with mass and radiation. Matter is everywhere, almost perfectly uniform.
